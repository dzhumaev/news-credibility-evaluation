1,"This hairless cat ""has a face on her butt"" - and everyone thinks it looks like Voldemort

Social media users were quick to point out its uncanny resemblance to He Who Must Not Be Named

Us humans have a knack for seeing faces where there really shouldn't be faces.

Whether it's seeing Jesus in a tree stump or the Queen's face in a baby scan, our brains can play tricks on us in the strangest ways.

But even the most skeptical of people must admit that this face-on-a-cat-bum is pretty weird.

The image was uploaded to Imgur by the cat's owners yesterday, along with the caption: ""Our hairless cat has a face on her butt.""

Although the owners didn't see the resemblance to Voldemort initially, it was pointed out by several amused commentators.

One said: ""When Voldemort gave up his human form, he had few choices left for the shredded remains of his final horcrux soul fragment. He looks glum.""

Another commented: ""Voldemort is getting desperate these days, I see.""

More people still were more disturbed by the fact that its tail looked like a tongue, with one saying: ""That ""tail-tongue"" is freaking me the f*** out.""",uncertain,test
2,"Supermodel Pattie Boyd exhibits more images of her life with pop icons

A sneak preview of life behind the scenes with two of the world's top pop icons was unveiled Thursday on the eve of a new exhibition in Liverpool.

Almost 60 photographs taken by Pattie Boyd, former wife of music legends the ex-Beatle George Harrison and rock guitarist Eric Clapton, go on display Friday in an exclusive exhibition at The Beatles Story.

""George, Eric and Me"" is Boyd's first major solo exhibition in Britain and will continue in Liverpool for six months.

Boyd, a former supermodel who was the inspiration for the hit songs ""Layla"" and ""Wonderful Tonight,"" has selected the intimate portraits from her personal archives.

Through the lens of her camera, she provides insight into her life with two musical world icons.

The exhibition incorporates images that feature the musicians' friends and collaborators including George Harrison's fellow Beatles band members as well as images of the Rolling Stone's Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood.

Boyd said Thursday: ""I'm delighted that my images are now on display at The Beatles Story. Whilst I unfortunately can't be there in person today, I am looking forward to visiting the attraction soon to enjoy the exhibition.

""The exhibition is a glimpse into my life during that period and it will be wonderful to see people's reaction to the collection of images I've selected for display.""

The photographer and former model was married to Harrison from 1966 to 1977, and Clapton from 1979 to 1989.

Boyd was due in Liverpool Thursday to open the exhibition, but injured her hip and elbow in an accident while out walking her dog.

Martin King of The Beatles Story said: ""We are thrilled to launch this exhibition at The Beatles Story and that Pattie has chosen the attraction to house this collection of images.""

""The images on display are truly beautiful snapshots of Pattie's life with two of the greatest musicians of all time. Through Pattie's lens, we are able to see a rare glimpse into unguarded moments and it is a pleasure to be able to share these images with music fans.""

The award-winning Beatles Story is the world's largest permanent exhibition purely devoted to the lives and times of The Beatles. It is located in the Fab Four's hometown of Liverpool at the Albert Dock, a UNESCO World Heritage site.",high,test
3,"UN chief names new special representative for Guinea-Bissau

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday announced the appointment of Modibo Toure of Mali as his new special representative for Guinea-Bissau and head of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS).

Toure replaces Miguel Trovoada of Sao Tome and Principe, who completed his assignment on April 30.

The secretary-general is grateful to Trovoada's leadership and for the accomplishments of the UN Mission during his tenure at UNIOGBIS, Ban's spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here.

Toure served as special adviser to the special envoy for the Great Lakes Region from 2013 to 2015.

Prior to that, he was the United Nations resident coordinator, humanitarian coordinator and resident Representative ad interim of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in Kenya in 2013.

He worked in 2012 as the deputy special representative of the UN secretary-general, resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator ad interim in the Central African Republic, and served as UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator and UNDP resident representative in Chad and Ethiopia.

He held high-level positions in the African Development Bank and served as the minister of new technologies, telecommunications and post office in Mali.",high,test
4,"Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading killer of college athletes. Here's the NCAA's plan of attack.

Basketball fans attending Loyola Marymount University's game against the University of Portland in March 1990 thought they were in for a spirited semifinal game. But then the unthinkable happened: 23-year-old Hank Gathers, a 6-foot 7-inch superstar, collapsed on the court. Stunned fans later learned that he died of sudden cardiac arrest -- a condition that still kills between five and 10 NCAA athletes every year. Now, 26 years later, the NCAA has issued new guidance on how to prevent those kinds of deaths.

It's the result of a multi-year process initiated by the association, which convened a task force of cardiovascular and sports medicine experts, student athletes, and athletic trainers to decide what to do about sudden cardiac deaths in sports back in 2014. The group came up with a consensus statement recently published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The document identifies the purpose of pre-participation evaluations, best practices for those screenings, and guidelines for how officials should plan for and handle emergency cardiac arrest when it's in progress.

Just how bad is the problem? In 2011, researchers from the University of Washington at Seattle used an NCAA database, public media reports, and catastrophic insurance claims to come up with an incidence rate for sudden cardiac death among students who died suddenly during exercise. They found that 75 percent of sudden deaths among student athletes who died during exercise could be traced to cardiovascular causes and that the current methods of collecting data underestimate the risk of sudden cardiac death.

The NCAA itself found that the risk of a male athlete dying from sudden cardiac arrest is one in 38,000 and only one in about 122,000 for female athletes. Basketball, soccer, and football players appear to be at the greatest risk -- though only 4 percent of NCAA athletes are basketball players, they represent a full 20 percent of all sudden cardiac deaths.

But though the recommendations give guidelines on how to use electrocardiograms (ECGs) to predict those kinds of risks to student athletes, they stop short of actually recommending them. ""We're not mandating or recommending that they be done across the board,"" says Brian Hainline, staff senior vice president and chief medical officer of the NCAA. In 2015, Hainline, who is the NCAA's first-ever chief medical officer, backtracked on a publicly announced plan to require all student athletes to receive ECGs when team physicians from over 100 universities protested.

""Look, people have been talking about electrocardiogram screening for a long time, but it's been so polarized that you have two camps and the two camps just keep saying the same thing and you're not moving forward in a consensus-driven manner,"" Hainline says. One camp insists that EKGs are a critical predictive tool that can identify cardiac conditions, like myocarditis, a disease that inflames and can damage the heart muscle and that is associated with sudden cardiac death. The other holds that since so few student athletes have the kinds of cardiac problems that can be detected by EKG and that put them at risk for sudden death, the procedure shouldn't be performed as a requirement for participation -- a position held by organizations like the American Heart Association.

""For a lot of sudden cardiac deaths, the first symptom is sudden cardiac death,"" says Justin Wright, assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso. A sports-medicine-trained physician, Wright directs the school's sports medicine program. ""Our current system isn't perfect, but I'm not sure that EKG screening may not be the perfect answer, either.""

The new consensus statement neatly sidesteps the EKG issue: It provides best practices for institutions that choose to require the tests as part of screening, but stops short of recommending it be implemented across the board. It may be cautious when it comes to how to predict cardiac arrest risks, but when it comes to how organizations should treat it while it's happening, the statement minces no words. ""The debate about the effectiveness of various screening examinations ... will undoubtedly continue,"" it reads. ""However, there is no debate that a well-rehearsed and effectively implemented [emergency action plan] ... is effective at reducing the risk of death.""

To that end, the statement insists that coaching staff, referees and other responders be trained, that emergency plans be in place, and that working automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) be available during practice and play. When Gathers collapsed back in 1990, CPR was initially not administered because he was responsive. However, an AED was unsuccessfully used to save his life, and once Gathers registered no pulse, CPR was unsuccessfully used.

Perhaps a more cohesive emergency plan -- or a more rigorous cardiovascular screening -- could have saved Gathers. But Hainline hopes that the new guidelines can keep today's athletes and those of the future from dying during sports. ""No matter what we do, there's always going to be a risk of someone dying of sudden cardiac arrest,"" he says. ""In all sports settings the most important thing we can do is make certain that all of the appropriate people are CPR and AED trained.""

Wright, who oversees medical game coverage for the University of Texas at El Paso and local high schools, agrees. ""Everyone thinks they're going to rise to the occasion, but most of the time we fall back to our level of training,"" he says. ""It's not difficult to learn CPR.""",high,test
5,"Sevilla make it a hat-trick of Europa League finals after seeing off Shakhtar

Kevin Gameiro scored twice as Sevilla saved their best form for the Europa League and made their third straight final with a 3-1 second-leg win over Shakhtar Donetsk. Gameiro picked up where he left off after grabbing a late equaliser in the first leg last week, firing a ninth-minute opener at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan to set his side on course for a 5-3 aggregate win. Shakhtar drew level through Marlos, but Gameiro's second and a third for Mariano ensured the run of Unai Emery's side would continue.

The form guide had suggested Shakhtar had a chance of victory with Sevilla limping into the game on the back of an indifferent 1-0 loss at Espanyol last weekend, while the visitors thrashed their domestic rivals Dynamo Kiev 3-0.

But as two consecutive Europa League crowns prove, Sevilla are a different proposition in Europe and it did not take them long to take the lead on the night when Gameiro seized on a mistake by Maksim Malyshev to fire home.

There was plenty of early frustration evident in the Shakhtar ranks with Marlos, Yaroslav Rakitskiy and Oleksandr Kucher all booked in the first half-hour as their side struggled to get a grip.

Only a superb interception from Taras Stepanenko prevented a golden second chance for Gameiro, but Shakhtar slowly grew in confidence and a near-miss from Ismaily served as a warning for the hosts.

Moments before half-time Shakhtar made their pressure pay when Marlos played Eduardo into the box and the Croatian fired his side level - and still had time to miss the chance to add a second before the break.

Shakhtar's relief lasted just two minutes into the second half before the dangerous Ever Banega threaded a neat ball into the box from out on the right and Gameiro kept his cool to round goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov and make it 2-1.

Sevilla began to pour on the pressure, with Mariano testing Pyatov and Banega firing wide before the increasingly inevitable third arrived in the 59th minute with Mariano's super finish from a Vitolo through-ball.

Grzegorz Krychowiak almost made it four when he flashed a header wide from Banega's free-kick 10 minutes later, while Eduardo also came close to what surely would have been a consolation for the visitors.

Shakhtar's frustrations spilled over in the final minutes with Stepanenko in particular fortunate to avoid a red card after a pair of tasty challenges, as Sevilla cruised into their third straight final in style.",high,test
6,"Dana White refutes report of Conor McGregor - Floyd Mayweather fight

When Floyd Mayweather Jr. last weekend referred to a comeback fight for ""nine figures,"" was he referring to a date with Ultimate Fighting Championship star Conor McGregor?

The Sun tabloid in England reported Friday that, ""Both sides just have to agree on the purse and sign the paperwork -- which sources say is imminent -- and an announcement is likely to be made in the coming weeks"" for a summer fight.

UFC President Dana White told the Los Angeles Times on Friday that the question about McGregor-Mayweather was the first he had heard of it.

""McGregor-Mayweather? No,"" White said.

""It'd be very hard to pull off. I've heard Floyd is on a worldwide vacation on Mayweather Air spending millions in every country he visits.""

And when asked if McGregor could fight outside the UFC in a boxing match of his choosing, White said, ""Never.

""We're his promoter. We'd have to make the fight.""

White said McGregor has never even raised the idea to him about any interest in boxing Mayweather.

White called the Sun report ""completely fiction, this is like bottom-feeder ... stuff.""

The UFC has permitted only one MMA-boxing fight, and that was in a UFC cage when former two-division champion Randy Couture cruised to victory over former boxing champion James Toney.

McGregor, whose strength is stand-up fighting, has engaged Mayweather in a social-media war of words, and before his March 5 loss to Nate Diaz, there was buzz that such a bout would generate a financial windfall even if Mayweather's sharp, well-developed skill would likely dominate the charismatic Irishman.

According to the Sun report, a source said, ""Floyd went mad after Conor said he would crush him and knock him out in 30 seconds, he's obsessed with making Conor eat his words. Floyd is calling the shots. It's strictly boxing and Conor will have to lose roughly 25 pounds.

""It was agreed in principle on May 2, but Floyd wouldn't reveal the identity of his opponent until last night when he told friends he'll be fighting Conor.""

McGregor is currently in a riff with UFC after failing to appear at a news conference in Las Vegas last month. The UFC scratched his scheduled July 9 UFC 200 main-event welterweight rematch against Diaz, despite McGregor lobbying for reconsideration.

Oddsmaker Bovada set McGregor as a 20-1 underdog in the fight, denoting such a bout would have to be sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

7,"Court Papers Show Joe Paterno Probably Knew About Jerry Sandusky Child Sex Abuse

Child allegedly came forward in 1976 to report problems.

While the late Penn State Head Coach Joe Paterno always claimed he didn't know about his longtime colleague Jerry Sandusky's abuse of children, shocking new documents seem to prove otherwise.

State now alleges that ""in 1976, a child allegedly reported to PSU's Head Coach Joseph Paterno that he [the child] was sexually molested by Sandusky.""

The order in question also states that between 1987 and 1988 there were multiple assistant coaches who witnessed Sandusky's inappropriate interactions with kids, and one case, state the papers, was allegedly referred to the school's top official in the athletic department.

Sandusky, who worked under Paterno for thirty years, was convicted in 2012 on charges he sexually abused 10 boys between 1994 and 2008. Penn State has had to dole out over $60 million to settle the dozens of civil claims stemming from Sandusky's actions during that period.

Paterno's family has released a statement dismissing the latest revelations in the insurance case, insisting the coach, who died in January 2012, was completely in the dark about Sandusky and never covered anything up.

""Over the past four-and-a-half years Joe Paterno's conduct has been scrutinized by an endless list of investigators and attorneys,"" said Wick Sollers, the Paternos' lawyer.

""Through all of this review there has never been any evidence of inappropriate conduct by Coach Paterno. To the contrary, the evidence clearly shows he shared information with his superiors as appropriate.""

""An allegation now about an alleged event 40 years ago, as represented by a single line in a court document regarding an insurance issue, with no corroborating evidence, does not change the facts,"" Sollers noted, adding, ""Joe Paterno did not, at any time, cover up conduct by Jerry Sandusky.""",uncertain,test
8,"Clinton more likely to win U.S. presidency than Trump: PredictIt

Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has a higher probability than her likely Republican rival Donald Trump of becoming the next U.S. president, but the gap between the pair narrowed this week, according to the online political stock market PredictIt.

Clinton's probability on Friday was 61 percent, down from 65 percent seven days ago, according to the site, which allows users to wager small amounts of money on ""yes"" or ""no"" predictions of future events. The probability that Trump will win the Nov. 8 election was 40 percent, up from 34 percent.

Trump's sweeping victory in this week's Indiana primary prompted his remaining Republicans rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich to drop out of the race, cementing the businessman's status as the party's presumptive nominee.

He is now testing out themes to use against Clinton to persuade disgruntled Republicans to get behind his campaign. On Friday, he criticized her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state.

PredictIt is jointly run by Washington political consultancy Aristotle and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. All of its users are registered U.S. voters.

As with polls, predictions markets like PredictIt do not always accurately forecast outcome. Ninety days ago, its users gave Trump a 20 percent probability of winning the presidency, illustrating how the celebrity businessman's momentum was underestimated.

11,"""Russian Rambo"", hero of Kremlin's Syria campaign, buried with pomp

A special forces officer killed in Syria, nicknamed the Russian Rambo by state media, was buried on Friday in a blaze of publicity and pomp, with the Kremlin allowing blanket TV coverage as an exception for 25-year-old Alexander Prokhorenko.

The senior lieutenant - whose media nickname refers to John Rambo, a fictional Vietnam veteran - had called in a strike on himself in March near Palmyra after being encircled by Islamist fighters, his commanders say.

Russia has been keen to stress its role in helping the army in Syria retake the ancient Syrian city by providing air strikes guided by special forces troops like Prokhorenko but has at times been reluctant to admit its military losses there.

It staged a concert in the city's Roman amphitheatre on Thursday evening to underscore its involvement.

A school and a street are due to be named in Prokhorenko's honor and President Vladimir Putin posthumously gave him the Hero of Russia award, the country's highest military medal for his ""courage and heroism"".

It took weeks to retrieve and identify Prokhorenko's body, and he was buried in his home village of Gorodki, about 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Moscow.

""Kurdish militia squads took part in getting Alexander Prokhorenko's body out,"" a representative of the Syrian Kurds in Russia, Farkhad Patiev, told state TV at the funeral.

""What he did was a great heroic deed. We need to always remember this.""

State TV showed a black coffin draped in a Russian flag with an officer's cap perched on top being carried by eight soldiers in full uniform with a guard of honor of five more servicemen.

Army generals and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had paid their respects on Thursday, meeting Prokhorenko's parents at a Moscow airport before their son's body was flown to Gorodki.

Prokhorenko, one of eight Russian soldiers whose death in Syria has been publicly admitted by the Russian government, served in the Special Operations Forces, a military unit extensively trained for clandestine missions abroad.

Russia denies it has boots on the ground in Syria. It says Prokhorenko was directing Russian air strikes against Islamic State forces. Another officer from the unit, Fyodor Zhuravlyov, was killed in Syria in late November but his death was kept secret for four months.

13,"Bosses take bigger share of top British firms' profits

Chief executives at Britain's largest companies had a pay cut last year. But profits fell further, ensuring a decade-long trend of bosses taking a rising share of corporate profits continued.

The average pay for chief executives of a company in the blue chip FTSE 100 index was 5.23 million pounds ($7.6 million)last year, down from 5.36 million in 2014, a Reuters examination of corporate filings shows.

However, FTSE 100 profits fell over 40 percent, helping to lift CEOs' earnings to the equivalent of 0.58 percent of their companies' total profits for the year, from 0.32 percent in 2014.

This represents a leap over the past decade. In 2005, CEO compensation, including pensions and share awards, was just 0.1 percent of pre-tax earnings, the Reuters analysis of annual reports over the period shows.

Rapid growth in executive pay has long drawn criticism from some politicians and media headlines denouncing corporate ""fat cats"". Now shareholders are increasingly raising their concerns, notably over a bumper deal for BP Plc's (BP.L) boss Bob Dudley as the oil giant reported its biggest ever annual loss.

Measured against share prices, the balance of gains and losses has also tipped in CEOs' favor.

The FTSE 100 index dropped around five percent last year but CEO pay at the component stocks fell only 2 percent. Between 2005 and the end of 2015, the index gained almost 30 percent, while CEO pay doubled at the 87 current FTSE companies where comparable data is available.

Executive pay consultants say UK packages are well above continental European levels but fall short of those in the United States.

Most companies deny there is a problem with pay. They say they have responded to investors' demands to link packages to performance, limiting fixed payouts including pension contributions. Any apparent lack of correlation with profits or share price is often due to market spikes, broader economic trends or one-off events, they say.

INVESTOR ANGER

In recent weeks, investors have expressed their anger at annual general meetings.

Over half of BP shareholders voted against Dudley's $20 million pay deal for 2015, a year when the company lost $6.5 billion. The vote was not binding but the company said it will consult investors on future pay deals.

BP said Dudley's pay partly reflected the fact that he hit targets including safety goals, while the loss reflected low oil prices and legal settlements related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which occurred before he became CEO.

Pay campaigners and governance groups have also criticized a 70 million pound package for WPP chief Martin Sorrell before the world's biggest advertising company holds its AGM next month.

WPP said the payout was linked to a share plan which required Sorrell to agree not to sell some of his shares in the company for five years. This exposed him to considerable financial risk, a spokesman said.

Some pay experts say the Reuters data shows a fundamental shift in value from investors to bosses.

""Shareholders really need to be concerned,"" said David Pitt-Watson, Executive Fellow of Finance at the London Business School and an adviser to insurer Aviva.

""If you're getting statistics where you're seeing a hugely greater proportion of the profits of a company going out to one individual ... then that's something that needs to give you a greater worry,"" added Pitt-Watson, who was previously a board member of Hermes Fund Managers.

NO BACK-SCRATCHING

The recent voting against pay plans is not new. During the ""shareholder spring"" of 2012, investors - who had historically used their advisory votes to back management overwhelmingly on the issue - voted in large numbers against remuneration schemes. This prompted some companies to amend their policies.

CEO pay is usually set by a company's remuneration committee, which typically comprises three non-executive directors.

Critics say such ""remcos"" are often made up of people with links to the CEO, sitting or former CEOs of other companies, or others who are predisposed to pay bosses a lot of money.

Louise Patten, head of the remuneration committee at FTSE 100-listed shopping center operator Intu Properties (INTUP.L), denied she and her peers were ""old chums, back-scratching"" the CEO.

""There are some outliers but I think, generally speaking, the system works. Remcos think about remuneration a lot and whether we have the right strategic drivers,"" she told Reuters on the sidelines of Intu's AGM.

Patten said the aim was to ensure alignment between remuneration and shareholder returns so that bosses had a strong incentive to do their job well. The proportion of profits that went to the CEO wasn't usually a focus for remuneration committees, with other measures such as relative performance against peers or share price being more important.

But even some company insiders question whether the split of rewards is fair.

""A lot of shareholders have got concerns about the direction of travel of executive pay. I share those concerns in some measure,"" Philip Hampton, chairman of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), told the drugmaker's AGM this week.

""Sometimes, maybe even frequently, it is not easy to see the linkage between the shareholder experience and the executive remuneration,"" said Hampton, a past chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland and retailer J Sainsbury Plc.

SHARE AWARDS

Not every element of remuneration has risen over the years. While seven figure pension contributions were common in 2005, the abolition of defined benefit plans and the introduction of caps has reduced the cost to shareholders of executive pensions.

Yet the expansion of share-based rewards has more than made up for this and largely explained the doubling of pay in a decade.

Some corporate leaders say CEOs may also be effectively charging more for their services because shareholders have been given a greater ability to get rid of them.

But some politicians and campaigners say shareholders are to blame for failing to hold companies to account.

Fund managers say it is hard to assess whether shareholders are getting value for money from a CEO. Profits can be erratic and executive windfalls can be generated by actions taken a few years earlier.

""To analyze it is very, very difficult and has so many elements and legs to it that it's not straight-forward,"" said Aidan Farrell, small-cap equities fund manager at Eaton Vance.

Last year was the first year for which companies were obliged to publish a single figure for total CEO pay. Previously, companies reported pension contributions and share awards separately and in their annual reports discouraged investors from including the value of pensions in CEO remuneration calculations.

The Colombian government says it will launch air raids against gangs involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining.

Defence Minister Luis Carlos Villegas said the full force of the state, including the military, would be used to fight them.

The gangs emerged from right-wing paramilitary squads disbanded under the last government of Alvaro Uribe, in office until five years ago.

Officials say there are three criminal gangs with about 3,000 members.

Air raids against left-wing Farc - country's largest rebel group - are currently suspended, as peace talks continue in an effort to end five decades of conflict.

""This will allow the application of the entire force of the state, without exception, against organised armed groups, against powerful mafias,"" Mr Villegas said.

The new strategy specifically targets three groups - the Clan Usuga, Los Pelusos and Los Puntilleros.

Clan Usuga, is the largest and is accused of trafficking cocaine to Central America and on to the US.

The Los Pelusos gang has strong links with the powerful Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. Los Puntilleros are involved in trafficking in Colombia's Catatumbo region.

Analysts say the decision to militarise the fight against organised crime marks a sharp turn in strategy as the government is nearing a peace deal with the Farc.

Air raids have been the most powerful military strategy against guerrilla groups and led to the deaths of many of their most feared commanders.

The government's decision to axe her role silences young people and teachers, the former mental health champion for schools in England says.

Natasha Devon told that she had wanted to give young people a voice at government level.

The loss of her role came after she had used a head teachers' conference to stress the level of mental strain being put on pupils by rigorous testing.

But the Department for Education denied the role was cut to silence criticism.

It said an ""independent NHS task force report"" published in February had ""recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created"", which had forced it to reconsider Ms Devon's role.

""Mental health crisis""

Ms Devon, who took up the post last August, told: ""When I first took the role, I said to the department what I want to do is... bring the concerns of young people and the people who teach them to government level.

""So it's not actually me that's being silenced, it's young people and teachers.

""I think the government knows that young people don't vote, or if they do they are very unlikely to vote Tory, and they have historically ignored their needs and the price they have paid is now we have seen a crisis in their mental health.""

Ms Devon, who was made a MBE in 2015 for her work helping young people conquer mental health and body image issues, said she had not been paid for the role as it was important she remained independent and objective.

She warned the new, paid mental-health champion could ""be paid effectively to toe the party line"".

17,"News Corp reports $149m quarterly loss

Media giant News Corp has reported a net loss of $149m for the three months to March. That compares with a profit of $23m in the same quarter last year.

The group suffered as a result of a one off legal charge of $280m at its News America Marketing business.

Revenue also fell - by 7.3% to $1.89bn.

News Corp, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, gets over half its revenue from outside the US and it blamed ""currency headwinds"" for the drop.

The one off charge at News America, an in-store advertising and grocery coupon business, was flagged up earlier this year. At that time, News Corp said it had agreed to pay $280m to resolve claims that News America had monopolised the market for in-store promotions at more than 50,000 retail outlets across the US.

News Corp's businesses include news and information services, book publishing, real estate services and cable network programming as well as pay-TV distribution in Australia.

In a statement released with the earnings, the media firm said: ""While we believe in the strength of our print properties, we are also investing energetically in the rapid pursuit of digital which is clearly evident in the transition at Dow Jones.

""At Dow Jones this quarter, digital accounted for more than 50% of total revenues for the first time, and digital-only subscribers at the Wall Street Journal grew to 893,000, representing nearly 45% of the base.""

Revenue at News Corp's online real estate services business which includes website realtor.com jumped 14% in the quarter to $194m.

Next quarter?

Meanwhile revenue from the book publishing business, which includes HarperCollins Publishers fell 11% to $358m.

News Corp's Chief Executive Robert Thomson said the company's third quarter performance was ""disappointing"".

However, he added, the company believes it is ""on track to see improvements in the fourth quarter, with the expansion of our digital real estate business, foreign currency comparisons hopefully beginning to ease, and cost saving initiatives taking firmer root.""",high,test
18,"Sanctions inspire Kalashnikov move into fashion

Russia's largest producer of small arms is branching out into fashion as a result of Western sanctions, it's reported.

The Kalashnikov Concern - maker of the widespread AK-47 assault rifle - will launch a ""military style"" casual clothing and accessories range as part of a diversification drive after it lost access to major markets, the pro-Kremlin daily Izvestia reports. It's planning to open 60 stores across Russia by the end of the year.

Kalashnikov's marketing director, Vladimir Dmitriyev, says that before sanctions were imposed, up to 70% of its hunting and sporting weapons were sold in Europe and the US. Now, he says, they're focusing more on what domestic consumers want.

Marketing consultant Nikolai Grigoryev thinks the fashion line could work by tapping into the ""rapid growth of patriotism in Russia related to the theme of war"". But he tells pro-Kremlin Life TV that it would still only constitute a small fraction of the company's total turnover.

Most web users commenting on the news are rather sceptical though, with one writing: ""Let's shut down production of weapons as it's unprofitable to maintain highly qualified specialists, and switch to making lace underwear under a well-known brand!"" Another user jokingly asks ""what calibre"" the clothes will be and ""will they be fitted with an under-barrel grenade-launcher?""

19,"""I feel sick, give me the bucket"": What 25 hours in virtual reality feels like

A Los Angeles writer set a world record after spending 25 hours playing a single game in virtual reality.

Derek Westerman, 32, took on the challenge after trying virtual reality for the first time earlier this year. Westerman was left wondering how long anyone could last in an experience that he considered intense and overwhelming.

When Westerman found out there was no world record for time spent in a virtual reality headset, Westerman pitched the stunt to Super Deluxe, a maker of comedic YouTube videos.

For the challenge Westerman spent the 25 hours making three-dimensional artwork in a game called Tilt Brush. Each hour Westerman would start a new painting, and shift between standing, sitting down or lying on the floor.

During the ordeal a support staff fed Westerman a few pieces of pizza and a Chipotle chicken burrito. The Guinness Book of World Records required two observers to keep a minute-by-minute journal of Westerman's actions. He was not allowed to sleep or stop playing the game. Bathroom trips were replaced by a red bucket.

Westerman thought about quitting as he grew fatigued by the marathon session. To conserve energy he would paint extremely slowly. At one point he vomited into the red bucket.

Westerman, who ultimately said it was a great experience, hasn't worn a virtual reality headset since setting the world record a month ago. For 24 hours after the experience Westerman said that everything looked uncanny. Spending a day in virtual reality changed how his brain registered space. Objects in the distance looked odd, as if they weren't real.

HTC, the maker of the headset Westerman wore, recommends virtual reality users take periodic breaks. An HTC spokesman said the company has no official comment on how long one can wear a Vive headset. Google, maker of the game Westerman played, declined to comment on whether it had any recommendations for how long some should play the game.

Westerman was relieved the side effects faded in a day.

Human senses are capable of adapting well to new and different circumstances, according to University of Maryland professor Amitabh Varshney, who leads its virtual reality research efforts. Varshney recalled an experiment in which an Australian professor outfitted his assistant with glasses that inverted his vision, turning the world upside down. While initially confused, before long he was able to perform everyday tasks such as ride a bicycle.

According to Varshney, Westerman's experience highlights the progress in virtual reality headsets and games, which is making some users actually consider spending extended periods of time in the headsets.

""If you tried virtual reality a few years ago your experience would be dramatically different than today,"" said Eric Romo, the chief executive of AltSpace, which creates virtual reality software. ""The inability of people to stay in virtual reality for a long period of time is not as real a problem as people think.""

Romo credits the change to the recent release of new headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, plus better virtual reality games and experiences.

Earlier this year a German man spent 48 hours in a virtual reality headset playing games. At one point he complained of a rapid heartbeat, which he later concluded was a panic attack. But after the experience he was in good spirits.

Westerman's need to puke in a bucket is also a reminder that the health impacts of the new technology have not been well-studied, according to Varshney, leaving users largely on their own to make sure they don't overdo it.

Before his own challenge Westerman had concerns about whether he would do any serious damage to his health. He said a brief Google search led him to a few concerning message board posts warning of trouble focusing one's eyes after long periods of virtual reality. Ultimately, he said, a nihilist worldview lead him to push forward. Given his enjoyment of extremely long movies, Westerman figured he could make it through.

Westerman expects his record to be broken shortly and would recommend the experience to an interested person. But he won't be attempting another marathon session. He compared the decision to having watched a favorite movie for the first time and not wanting to re-watch it for fear of ruining the positive memory.

""I maxed out what I wanted,"" Westerman said.""I'm just not chasing that dragon anymore.""",high,test
20,"Lawyer's Arrest in Egypt Signals Determination to Quell Criticism

A prominent human rights lawyer was arrested here on Thursday, joining more than 1,200 people detained after protests against the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.

The lawyer, Malek Adly, was arrested on a raft of charges that included plotting to overthrow the state and spreading false news, his lawyer said. He is being held in pretrial detention for an initial period of 15 days, but under Egyptian law it could stretch to several years.

His arrest signaled how President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, evidently rattled by public opposition to the transfer of the two islands, Tiran and Sanafir, is determined to quell growing criticism from lawyers, journalists and activists.

Mr. Sisi, who only a year ago seemed unchallengeable, is grappling with a steep economic downturn and unusually vocal criticism. Demonstrations in the center of Cairo and other cities on April 15, though small by Egyptian standards, were the largest since 2013 when Mr. Sisi introduced a tough new law effectively outlawing public protest.

Mr. Sisi has blamed unspecified hostile forces for his woes, and in speeches he has urged Egyptians to give him their unwavering support. ""The more you succeed, the more the forces of evil will look for new wiles and more schemes,"" he told farmers at a wheat harvest event this week.

At the same time, security officials have undergirded his authority with mass arrests. The Front for the Defense of Egypt's Protesters, a network of lawyers and civil society groups, said the security forces arrested 1,277 people after the April 15 protest and a second, smaller protest on April 27.

Hundreds were quickly released but at least 577 of them have been formally charged, said Ragia Omran, a lawyer with the protesters' group. ""After the protest law, a lot of people stepped away from the political scene,"" she said. ""This recent incident has given them a spark to go back to the protest movement.""

The government is also under fire from journalists after the police stormed the headquarters of the country's only press union on Sunday and arrested two reporters. Days later, the arrests turned to embarrassment for the government when the Interior Ministry accidentally released its guidelines for combating negative publicity over the episode.

As the furor over the arrests mounted during the week, the union called for the resignation of the interior minister, Maj. Gen. Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, and ordered newspapers to refrain from publishing his name. It has also called on newspapers to publish partially blacked-out front pages as a protest on Sunday.",high,test
21,"Singapore, Australia expand military cooperation in $1.7 billion deal

Australia and Singapore have agreed to jointly develop military training areas and facilities in Australia in a sign of how China's increasingly assertive military presence in the region is encouraging nations to boost their own defense capabilities.

Singapore will fund a A$2.25 billion (US$1.7 billion) expansion of military training facilities in Australia, a government source told Reuters.

Singapore will have enhanced and expanded military training access in Australia over a period of 25 years. The two will strengthen intelligence and information sharing, such as in counter-terrorism, the city-state's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday.

The move to forge closer military ties between Australia and Singapore comes at a time of rising tensions between much of Asia and China, which has been building military and civilian facilities on its artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea.

""The kind of military relationships that (Singapore) have and types of military ties that they are developing and deepening, they don't have with China,"" said Richard Bitzinger, a security expert at the S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

""I am not saying that this is being done overtly to deal with China, but I wouldn't be surprised if that isn't a major driver behind this.""

The region is also facing rising risks from Islamic extremists. Earlier this week, Singapore said it had detained eight Bangladeshi men who were planning attacks in their homeland. It deported five others who were arrested by police in Dhaka.

Land-scarce Singapore has long sent troops to Australia for military exercises. The new deal would allow the Asian nation to increase the number of troops it has on rotation in Australia to 14,000, from 6,000.

Under the agreement, Singapore would fund the cost of expanding the Shoalwater Bay Training Area and the Townsville Field Training Area, both in the north of Queensland state.

Both bases lie in electorates critical to the government. The timing of the agreement is viewed as a political coup for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ahead of an anticipated July federal election.

""Under our comprehensive strategic partnership, our aim is to elevate our relationship to a level similar to the one we enjoy with New Zealand,"" Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.

He said the new partnership will also generate a construction boom in North Queensland due to the need for roads, accommodation and facilities for the Singaporean Defence forces.

The agreement makes Singapore the only other foreign country to invest in military infrastructure in Australia besides the United States.

Earlier this week Reuters reported that Singapore will soon pick the winner of a $1 billion tender for military utility helicopters, as it modernizes its air force and navy amid rising tensions in the region.

The city-state and Australia also updated a free trade agreement, which includes improved access for businesses to bid for government procurement contracts and allowed for easier movement of people between the two markets.

Singapore is Australia's fifth largest trading and investment partner, with bilateral trade of S$20.2 billion ($14.86 billion) in 2015. The city-state has investments amounting to A$80.2 billion in Australia.",high,test
22,"Wall Street gives up on June rate hike by Fed after payrolls disappoint: poll

Wall Street's top banks have all but abandoned any expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June, and most now see the U.S. central bank's next rate hike coming in September, according to a Reuters survey conducted on Friday.

Friday's weaker-than-expected payrolls report for April acted as the catalyst for several economists at primary dealers to back away from their previous predictions for an interest rate increase at the Fed's next meeting in June.

Moreover, conviction among primary dealers that the Fed would pull off more than one hike in 2016 is quickly eroding as well, with the soft employment data standing as only the latest indicator that U.S. economic growth is far from robust.

U.S. employers added 160,000 jobs in April, the fewest in seven months. Economists had anticipated more than 200,000 jobs had been added last month.

""This report did very little to make the case for a June rate hike,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. ""The data today really underscores our view that the Fed will want to see more data before hiking rates further.""

TD Securities' economists were among those shifting their view on the next rate hike to September in Friday's survey from June in a similar poll taken one month ago. Reuters surveyed the 23 primary dealers, the largest banks authorized to trade directly with the Fed, following Friday morning's release of the monthly U.S. payrolls report, and had input from 18.

Fifteen of those 18 forecast the federal funds rate will remain at its current level of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent at the end of the second quarter. In April, 10 of 16 dealers expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of June.

Thirteen of the 18 expect the Fed to lift rates by a quarter percentage point to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent by the end of the third quarter.

Meanwhile, just nine of 17 respondents see a second rate hike later in 2016 to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent. A month ago, 12 of 16 had forecast at least two rate hikes this year.

""They need more time to be sure that the weakness in the first quarter is temporary,"" said Dana Saporta, economist at Credit Suisse. ""The first rate hike will likely come in the second half (of the year), starting with one in September, followed by one in December.""

Most dealers said their conviction about a rate hike by the end of June had decreased since last month, and the median probability assigned by them to a June increase fell to 18 percent from 50 percent in April.

The dealers also lengthened their estimated timeline before the Fed would start reducing its $4.45 trillion balance sheet. The median forecast indicates no reduction before 2018 compared with mid-2017 in April's survey.

Dealers continue to see very little probability that the Fed will employ negative interest rates as several of its peer central banks have done around the world. Respondents see just a 10 percent probability of the Fed following suit, unchanged from the April survey.",high,test

Geordie Shore star's family haven't been supportive of her sexuality

Marnie Simpson was told she was ""a waste of a woman"" by her own mother after coming out as bisexual.

The Geordie Shore star came out 2 weeks ago following a few steamy make-out sessions with Chloe Ferry on the MTV reality show.

But Marnie hasn't had much support from her loved ones - who only found out when she spoke about her sexuality in public.

She told: ""It came out in the press and then my mum got in touch. It's still a very awkward thing with my mum. She isn't very happy about it.

""She doesn't like it and I don't think she ever will. She keeps saying I'm a waste of a woman.

""She keeps talking about grandkids and stuff. She thinks I'm a full on lesbian and will get married to a woman. It's like you don't know that, there's a chance I'll end up with a man or a woman.

""It's not a big deal but my mum takes it very seriously. It's been hard because I want to talk about it with my mum, but she loves me no matter what.""

Marnie went on to claim her Geordie Shore co-star Aaron Chalmers has been ""lying"" about supporting her decision to come out.

Talking of her former flame, she said: ""Aaron's being a d**k about it, actually. He probably said something different to you because he's a liar.

""Aaron tries to play the good guy. If I showed you some texts on my phone, he would not be the good guy.

Referencing Natalie Phillips - who she was rumoured to be dating after a string of cosy-looking social media posts - Marnie added: ""He's friends with a girl I've got with and he's not happy about it. Am I bothered?""

""He had about two and a half or three years to get with me and did he? No. He's a d**k. I actually think Aaron is gay himself.""",uncertain,test
24,"Treasury rejects plan to cut pension benefits for some retirees

The Treasury Department rejected a plan that would have substantially cut pension benefits for nearly 300,000 former and current truckers and their family members.

The proposal from the Central States Pension Fund, one of the largest multi-employer plans in the country, was the first test of a 2014 law that allowed financially distressed multi-employer plans to shrink benefits for retirees even if the fund had not yet run out of money.

The rejection of the cuts buys more time for the retirees who would have seen their income severely cut.

Kenneth Feinberg, the special master appointed by the Treasury to review the proposal, said the plan was rejected because the changes would not do enough to improve the financial health of the pension fund. ""We at Treasury do not believe that the plan, as submitted, will reasonably avoid insolvency,"" Feinberg said during a press call Friday.

In a letter to the pension fund, he also said he rejected the proposal because the cuts would not have been ""equitably distributed"" across all participants. And he said that the explanations sent out to retirees about the changes were not clear enough to help members understand how they would be affected.

Leaders of the pension fund, which proposed the cuts last fall, could come up with another proposal to reduce benefits that would also meet the requirements set by the law.

Consumer advocates and members of the plan say they hope lawmakers will rally to support alternative legislation that could help the fund in a way that is less painful for retirees.

One bill introduced on the issue would help retirees by leading to government assistance for the insurance fund supporting multi-employer plans. Another bill would give retirees and workers more power to approve or reject cuts proposed for their plan. But it's not clear how likely it is that either of these solutions will become law.

Feinberg also pointed out that his decision on the Central States fund does not mean that other pension plans applying to cut benefits will also have their proposals rejected. At least three other plans have already applied to the Treasury to cut benefits, and he said some of them may meet the requirements set by the law.",high,test
25,"Get cozy with your skin bacteria -- they're not going anywhere

When Josiah Zayner's health problems became too much to bear, he decided to make a radical lifestyle change - and tried to get rid of every microbe living in his gut or on his skin. A recent profile in the Verge follows Zayner's grueling process, which involved a regimen of antibiotics and disinfectants followed by an inoculation with a healthy friend's native bacteria. He swallowed pills containing his friend's feces and bathed himself in liquid full of the healthy man's skin microbes. The poop pills seem to have worked; the bacterial bath failed. After the ill-advised experiment, the microbes on Zayner's skin were largely unchanged. One new study may help explain why.

There are plenty of reasons to want to change the bacteria that live on and in you. Scientists have linked a large number of these human-loving microbes to particular measures of health or illness. A certain species of bacteria might make your gut ever-slightly-so more prone to obesity. Another might give you the healthy, regular bowel movements you've been trying to create with endless fiber supplements and diet shifts. Yet another might have made you more prone to asthma as a child.

You might think that the surface of your skin, which comes in contact with countless foreign surfaces teeming with their own bacteria every day, would change with regularity. But previous research has shown that humans tend to change the bacterial makeup of the environments we encounter -- we leave our microbial ""fingerprints"" everywhere, and even colonize hotel rooms with our preferential species within a few hours. According to a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, the microbes on our skin are surprisingly resilient over time.

Senior study authors Heidi Kong of the National Cancer Institute and Julie Segre of the National Human Genome Research Institute found that microbes showed a strong preference for particular skin types, like moist areas around the genitals, oily regions like the outer ear canal or dry areas like the palm of the hand. That wasn't a surprise -- previous studies have shown that skin microbes tend to like certain terrain. If you compared your microbiome to that of a total stranger, their armpit bacteria would probably have more in common with your armpit bacteria than the microbes from the skin of your own forearm would.

The new study is small, showcasing just 12 individuals sampled at different intervals over the course of a couple years. But Kong and Segre say they found compelling evidence that microbes linger on the skin for a long time, with some species and sites showing even more resilience than others.

""The stability of a healthy individual's skin microbial communities extending beyond 1-2 years was surprising,"" Segre told The Post in an email. ""Despite routine skin hygiene and environmental exposures during these time periods, the composition of the skin microbial communities of an individual was relatively consistent. Some sites like the oily areas (back) were more similar over time, whereas some sites like the feet were more varied over time.""

The variability of feet may be due to our clothing habits. Most humans wear a rotation of different socks and shoes, and sometimes go barefoot, which means feet spend significant time stewing in different sorts of environments. A few hours in socks, an hour sweating at the gym in different shoes, and a trip to the shower followed by a few hours padding barefoot through your house's carpet might provide more chances for bacterial colonization than a few firm handshakes and quick swipes across foreign surfaces would in hands.

""Knowing that there is relative stability in healthy skin will be important in comparing the skin microbial communities in patients as well as potential future studies that explore whether we can alter our skin microbes,"" Kong added.

The skin, she explained, is the body's first line of defense against infection. Kong, Segre and their colleagues want to study how particular microbes might make us sick or healthy, but they're also interested in how the overall makeup of a microbial community can increase or decrease the skin's ability to protect us from foreign invaders.

Certain individuals in the study were more or less prone to variability -- even at sites like the feet -- than others, suggesting that behavior or even genetics could affect how tenacious our bacterial communities are. Understanding how variation helps or hurts an individual could be important. Are you more likely to pick up a dangerous infection if your microbes are stalwart and steadfast, or does a tendency towards quick variability make you more likely to battle those dangerous bacteria quickly? Further study is needed to find the answer.

It's possible that one day scientists will decide what makes a ""good"" skin microbiome and what makes a ""bad"" one. If that day ever comes, we could theoretically try to recolonize ourselves with a better mix of bacteria and fungi. But Kong and Segre strongly advise against any DIY attempts like Zayner's.

""The microbial communities provide tremendous health benefit (resisting colonization with pathogens, tuning the immune system), so we need to recognize that most endogenous microbes on our skin, in our guts, in our mouths are healthy,"" Segre told The Post in an email. Research suggests that bacterial skin communities are pretty individualized. While some individuals may have a luckier lot than others, that doesn't mean swapping one microbiome out for another will have the desired effect. And trying to become sterile enough to make it happen would be nearly impossible at best and incredibly dangerous at worst.

""We should start to think of ourselves as super-organisms,"" Segre added. ""Humans are ecosystems who are a combination of both trillions of human cells and trillions of microbes. Our health is determined by the interplay of all of the cells of our body.""

In other words, try to love the skin you're in -- and the microbes that live on it -- because you're pretty much stuck with most of them.",high,test

27,"Closing of Malaysian Fund Could Shift Billions in Debt to Government, Critics Fear

Plans by the Malaysian government to shut down the troubled state fund at the heart of a multinational investigation could saddle the government with billions of dollars in debt and may be a first step toward a government bailout, opposition leaders said.

The government announced plans this week to close the fund, which was created by Prime Minister Najib Razak and is suspected of being the source of hundreds of millions of dollars deposited in his personal bank accounts.

The Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday that it would absorb the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad. The ministry, which Mr. Najib oversees in his capacity as the country's finance minister, will take over 1MDB's remaining assets.

Critics are concerned that the ministry will also assume the fund's estimated $6.75 billion debt, setting the stage for a government bailout.

""My reading is that they will take the opportunity to transfer as much of the debt as possible to the Ministry of Finance,"" said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament. ""Our fear is that the Ministry of Finance will mount a multibillion dollar bailout of 1MDB, which is now unable to pay its debts.""

Government officials did not respond to requests for comment. The fund's president, Arul Kanda Kandasamy, declined to discuss plans for scaling back the fund, how much it owes or the possibility of a government bailout.

Malaysian officials once had high hopes for the fund, which Mr. Najib created in 2009, promising that its investments would produce significant revenue for the country. The fund had planned a $3 billion initial public offering for its energy assets as recently as last year, which could have generated even more cash.

But critics say that the wealth fund was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme and that huge sums it borrowed were fraudulently diverted to well-connected insiders.

At least seven countries are investigating 1MDB and numerous international bank transfers involving the fund. Swiss investigators said in January that $4 billion may have been misappropriated from 1MDB.

Mr. Najib's role in establishing 1MDB as prime minister, overseeing it as finance minister, directing its advisory board and reportedly receiving money from the fund has raised many questions about his culpability.

He denies any wrongdoing.

In January, Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali, who had been appointed by Mr. Najib, cleared him of any crime related to the transfers of $681 million into Mr. Najib's personal bank accounts. Mr. Apandi said the money was a gift from the Saudi royal family.

The Saudi foreign ministry disputed that explanation in February but changed its position last month, confirming that the money was a Saudi donation.

In all, Mr. Najib has banked more than $1 billion from various sources, his office has acknowledged.

The moves announced on Wednesday were in keeping with recommendations by a parliamentary committee, which issued a report critical of 1MDB last month.

The ministry said that it would take over 1MDB's assets, accept the resignation of the 1MDB board effective May 31 and abolish its advisory board, which Mr. Najib had overseen.

The ministry said it would appoint new members to the board ""to reflect the limited business profile of 1MDB.""

An adviser to Mr. Najib said that sales of 1MDB assets that are underway, combined with the transfer of other assets to the ministry, would leave 1MDB as a shell company without any operations. The fund will continue to service any remaining obligations, he said, but will eventually cease to exist.

Mahathir Mohamed, a former prime minister and a leading critic of Mr. Najib, charged that the fund's debts could bankrupt the government.

""The sum is so huge that if the government cannot pay them (the financiers), it could be bankrupted,"" he wrote in The Malaysia Chronicle on Thursday. ""This has happened to Greece.""

Mr. Mahathir also challenged the contention by Mr. Najib's allies that much of the money that the prime minister received came from a Saudi donor.

""None of his explanation can be believed,"" Mr. Mahathir said. ""No one would give this huge amount to anyone even if he had done something for Islam or for any other cause. The belief is that the money came from 1MDB, the only source of such sums accessible to Najib.""",high,test
28,"Wells Fargo told staff to keep quiet about missing papers: lawsuit

A former employee accused Wells Fargo & Co of instructing workers at a call center to refrain from telling customers about lost deeds or other missing documents, and of firing the worker who called the policy unethical, according to a lawsuit made public this week.

Duke Tran, who was a customer service specialist at the bank, says that his supervisor berated him for telling a husband and wife that their loan contract was missing from an internal system.

Tran and others later received an email instructing them not to tell customers about situations ""where we have a lost contract, deed, any type of document, really, but especially when it relates to securing a property,"" according to a copy of the email filed with the lawsuit.

The email told the employees ""to say that we need to do further research or something similar"" and then to escalate the phone call to a boss.

Representatives for Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, declined to comment on Friday.

Like other major lenders, Wells Fargo has been battered by lawsuits over its conduct before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Last month, it admitted to deceiving the U.S. government into insuring thousands of risky mortgages and agreed to pay $1.2 billion.

The U.S. Department of Justice had an option to join Tran in his case because his suit alleges fraud on the government. It has declined to do so. That is typically a sign the department thinks a lawsuit is unlikely to succeed.

Tran filed his lawsuit in June 2015 under court seal, which is common for suits alleging fraud on the government. U.S. District Judge Anna Brown in Portland, Oregon, ordered the papers unsealed on Thursday.

The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction.

Tran's trouble began around December 2013 when he took a call from a husband and wife about an upcoming balloon payment on a mortgage, according to the lawsuit.

Tran told them the bank's copy of the loan contract was missing, and when he reported the issue to a supervisor, he was told his job was in jeopardy, the suit says.

Other customers also had loan documents missing, and many of their loans had been acquired by Wells Fargo from First Union or SunTrust Bank, according to the lawsuit.

Tran was fired in November 2014 after more than 10 years with the bank, the lawsuit said.",high,test

Technology entrepreneur Elon Musk gave a public shout-out to the sharpest minds in manufacturing this week, calling on them to come help Tesla Motors Inc build a million all-electric cars a year by 2020.

Musk says he is ""hell-bent"" on making the Silicon Valley automotive upstart a manufacturing powerhouse, but his vision relies on finding veteran auto engineers to ramp up volume ten-fold in four years - a challenge even for established carmakers.

Tesla on Wednesday said it would build 500,000 cars in 2018, two years ahead of schedule, and close to 1 million by 2020. The same day Tesla said its vice presidents in charge of production and manufacturing were leaving.

""You're looking at a company with significant levels of management turnover at the highest ends, people without experience in the planning, design or build of vehicles, and you expect to crank it up at those kinds of volumes?"" asked Michigan-based auto manufacturing consultant Michael Tracy.

Putting aside the issue of capital requirements, auto experts point to a shortage of manufacturing engineers, whose ranks were thinning out even before the U.S. auto crisis hit in 2008.

""It's a constant issue we have in this country,"" said Garth Motschenbacher, director of employer relations at Michigan State University's College of Engineering.

""For the longest time manufacturing was seen as the dirty end of engineering,"" he said.

At the same time, Alphabet's Google and Apple are working on car programs and courting the same potential employees. So are established auto names like Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp.

A 2015 Deloitte report found it takes three months to hire skilled engineers, and the shortage is crimping manufacturers.

Robust early reservations for the upcoming Model 3 mass-market car may have assured Musk of demand, but now comes the execution, said automotive recruiter Stephen Parkford.

""It's like reservations for a restaurant that's not open yet. You got the menu, but you don't have a chef!"" he said.

Hiring a highly proven production engineer from a traditional carmaker who arrived with his entire team could speed the process, Parkford said.

But while young engineers will jump at the chance to work for Tesla, the ""by-the-numbers, disciplined manufacturing guys"" with 15-20 years experience will be harder to nab, said Cuneyt Oge, president of the Society of Automotive Engineers. One key obstacle is the high price of living in Silicon Valley.

Musk needs a visionary auto industry veteran, Oge said. ""But anyone with that kind of experience is going to say, 'Hey, Elon, you can't do this in two years.'""

Tesla is known for pushing the envelope on design and technology but has stumbled in manufacturing, with prior launches marked by delays and quality issues.

Traditional automakers have more human and financial resources than cash-burning Tesla: Tracy pointed to Nissan Motor Co Ltd's ability in 2004 to bring in 200 engineers from Japan to help fix quality issues at its recently opened assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi.

""Greybeards"" are crucial to build and run factory systems, said Oge. ""You can't just defy the laws of business physics which require you to go down a learning curve collectively to build that systems know-how,"" he said.

While Tesla employees may cite Musk's tirelessness and attention to detail, even bedding down inside his Fremont, California factory, others like consultant Tracy see a worrying sign.

""If Elon is sleeping in a sleeping bag in a conference room off of the final assembly line, then there's an awful lot happening in that factory that's wrong,"" Tracy said.",high,test
30,"Syria Palmyra concert: Canny Putin puts himself centre stage

We drove for more than 200 miles (320 km) through the dangerous territory of central Syria, with armoured vehicles behind and in front of us and Russian military helicopters circling overhead, bristling with weaponry.

In the seven coaches that made up our convoy were a couple of dozen world-class musicians from Russia's Mariinskiy Theatre Orchestra, including Vladimir Putin's close personal friend, the cellist Sergei Roldugin, who was recently implicated in the Panama Papers tax scandal.

There were also about 100 journalists in the convoy, the majority of them Russian but with a number from foreign countries as well - Britain, Canada, the United States and China among them.

This was an exceptionally large and unwieldy party to escort through a country involved in one of the world's nastiest civil wars.

Imagine the reaction if something had happened to us. It would have been a public relations disaster for President Putin and the Kremlin; the perception would have been that Russia had no real grip on Syria.

There was one moment on our way back from Palmyra to the coastal city of Latakia, at night-time, when our military guides warned us that there was shooting on the road ahead. We were ordered to close our curtains and switch off any sources of light. So the security wasn't entirely for show.

Only the strongest motive could have persuaded the Kremlin to take a risk like this.

A PR masterpiece

The concert went off remarkably well, with the orchestra playing (if only for 20 minutes - about the shortest concert the Mariinsky has ever played, I imagine) in the magnificent Roman-era theatre of Palmyra.

Russian television produced some brilliant shots, including one from a camera on a blimp a few hundred feet above the ruins.

On a huge screen on one side of the stage, President Putin appeared live from the Kremlin in Moscow, praising his armed forces for everything they had done in Syria. Mr Putin must have been feeling pretty relieved that nothing had gone wrong.

But whatever was it all about? Why go to so much trouble, and run such risks?

There's a simple answer. This coming Monday is the big Russian celebration of VE Day. It won't be as grand an occasion as last year, the 70th anniversary, but it will still be pretty big. President Putin clearly wants to show that under him the Russian Federation is as 
successful and strong as the old Soviet Union was under Stalin, back in 1945.

What better way to demonstrate the new world-reach of Russian power than to have Russia's best orchestra playing Prokofiev in the heart of the ancient city which Russian arms had played a major part in liberating from the so-called Islamic State? Brilliant, as long it worked. And it did work, magnificently.

The real hero of Palmyra

Watching from the Kremlin, a tad nervously, I thought - he knocked the microphone awkwardly at one point - Mr Putin had cause to feel pretty pleased with himself. He quite often seems to, at present.

Of course the whole thing was distinctly heavy-handed. That's another key indicator of Russian power at present. A purist would say that a bit of self-effacing modesty would have gone down better with the Syrians, and with the worldwide audience too.

But Mr Putin isn't exactly concentrating on Syrian public opinion at the moment. His big audience is at home in Russia.

The Syrian soldiers I was sitting with at the theatre in Palmyra applauded politely and tried to steer clear of the Russian soldiers, who don't always treat them with maximum care.

But the senior Russian officers at the very topmost tier of the theatre were absolutely delighted, clapping enthusiastically when Mr Putin spoke and grinning at each other. They knew that their boss had scored a public-relations triumph.

Palmyra was until recently a place of horror, where 12-year-old boys were handed guns and made to shoot Syrian army prisoners in the back of the head on the stage of the theatre.

A photograph on stage commemorated Palmyra's chief of antiquities, Khaleel al-Asaad, who helped to get many of Palmyra's finest treasures out of the city as IS closed in, and was beheaded when he refused to give the militants what they wanted. He was the real hero of Palmyra.

Perhaps, then, turning this occasion into a tribute to Vladimir Putin and his forces was a little less than tactful. But there is no doubt about it, in this breathtaking Roman setting the Russians staged a near-Roman triumph. And they made sure the world knew about it.",high,test
31,"Time to take climate action to next level: UN chief

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday urged the world's nations to ""take climate action to the next level,"" two weeks after 175 governments signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change in New York.

""We need action now,"" Ban said at the opening of the Climate Action 2016 summit in Washington D.C., a two-day meeting seeking to accelerate global action on climate change.

""Temperatures continue to climb. Arctic sea ice is melting fast. Droughts, storms and floods are costing lives and productivity,"" he said.

Ban stressed the need to accelerate the speed, scope and scale of response in the fight against climate change, both locally and globally.

He also called for ""a radical transformation of the global economy"" in order to realize the goal of achieving a zero-carbon world in the second half of this century.

Specially, the UN chief thanked China and the United States, two of the world's largest emitters, for their leadership in tackling climate change.

""Both have pledged significant reductions in their emissions,"" he said. ""And both have agreed in Paris on transparent rules of the road to monitor progress, enhance accountability and foster a race to the top to drive climate ambition.""

Also speaking at the event, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim called for investment in lower-carbon transport systems to move goods off roads and onto rail and waterways, and help move people in a more sustainable way.

Otherwise, the world would see emissions from transport account for up to 33 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, an increase from the current 23 percent, Jim said.

""Inaction means we will not meet our targets set in Paris, and the global temperature will soar above 2 degrees Celsius,"" he said. ""That would spell disaster for us, for our children, and for the planet.""

32,"Solar kids' who stop moving at night perplex doctors in Pakistan

Medics baffled by two brothers who behave normally in day but lapse into catatonic state as soon as sun sets

The two brothers have come to be known as the ""solar kids"" and their case has completely mystified Pakistani doctors. Shoaib Ahmed, 13, and his brother Abdul Rasheed, nine, are normal, active children during the day. But once the sun goes down, they both lapse into a vegetative state -- unable to move or talk.

Javed Akram, a professor of medicine at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, said on Thursday that he had no idea what was causing the symptoms. ""We took this case as a challenge. Our doctors are doing medical tests to determine why these kids remain active in the day but cannot open their eyes, why they cannot talk or eat when the sun goes down,"" he said, as he visited the pair at his hospital.

Akram said the government was providing free medical care to the siblings, who come from an impoverished family. The brothers are undergoing extensive medical testing in the capital, Islamabad, and samples of their blood have been sent to overseas specialists for further examination. Researchers are also collecting soil and air samples from the family's village.

Mohammad Hashim, the father of the two boys, comes from a village near Quetta, the capital of south-western Baluchistan province. He and his wife are first cousins and two of their six children died at an early age. Their other two children have not displayed any unusual symptoms. His simple theory: ""I think my sons get energy from sun.""

But doctors have already dismissed the idea that sunlight plays a role, noting that the boys can move during the day even when kept in a dark room or during a storm.

During the day, the boys did indeed seem normally active, energetic and cheerful as they emerged from their hospital room on Friday and walked to a nearby canteen to have tea. ""I will become a teacher,"" Shoaib said, while his younger brother said he wanted to be an Islamic scholar.",high,test

35,"Obama official says he pushed a ""narrative"" to media to sell the Iran nuclear deal

One of President Obama's top national security advisers led journalists to believe a misleading timeline of U.S. negotiations with Iran over a nuclear-disarmament agreement and relied on inexperienced reporters to create an ""echo chamber"" that helped sway public opinion to seal the deal, according to a lengthy magazine profile.

Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told the New York Times magazine that he helped promote a ""narrative"" that the administration started negotiations with Iran after the supposedly moderate Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013. In fact, the administration's negotiations actually began earlier, with the country's powerful Islamic faction, and the framework for an agreement was hammered out before Rouhani's election.

The distinction is important because of the perception that Rouhani was more favorably disposed toward American interests and more trustworthy than the hard-line faction that holds ultimate power in Iran.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Friday disputed the notion that there was anything misleading about the administration's advocacy of the agreement.

""I haven't seen anybody produce any evidence that that's the case,"" he said at his daily briefing. ""I recognize there might be some people who are disappointed that they did not succeed in killing the Iran deal. Maybe these unfounded claims are the result of sour grapes. The truth is, the administration, under the direction of the president, engaged in an aggressive campaign to make a strong case to the American people that the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon enhanced the national security of the United States.""

Rhodes, 38, said in the article that it was easy to shape a favorable impression of the proposed agreement because of the inexperience of many of those covering the issue.

""All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,"" he said. ""Now they don't. They call us to explain to them what's happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.""

Rhodes set up a team of staffers who were focused on promoting the deal, which apparently included the feeding of talking points at useful times in the news cycle to foreign policy experts who were favorably disposed toward it. ""We created an echo chamber,"" he told the magazine. ""They [the seemingly independent experts] were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.""

The manager of the White House's Twitter feed on Iran, Tanya Somanader, said one reporter, Laura Rozen of the Al-Monitor news site, became ""my RSS feed. She would just find everything and retweet it.""

Rozen, in an email, said she does not know Somanader and that David Samuels, the author of the magazine piece, did not ask her about the staffer's claim before publishing his story. ""As I read it, [Somanader] says my Twitter feed was a source of info for her .?.?. Samuels seems to mischaracterize that to say the opposite.""

She said she has had a long interest in U.S. policy on Iran and covered ""over 20 rounds of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations"" over four years. ""I do retweet lots of info, from lots of sources"" -- including, she noted, the Russian Ministry of Defense, ""which I hardly expect most to take at face value or as an endorsement."" She maintained that her coverage of the Iran nuclear diplomacy ""was certainly not done as a favor to or in support of any administration.""

Rhodes's assistant, Ned Price, told the newspaper that the administration would feed ""color"" -- background details -- to their ""compadres"" in the press corps, ""and the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they'll be putting this message out on their own.""

In the story, Rhodes speaks contemptuously of the Washington policy and media establishment, including The Washington Post and New York Times, referring to them as ""the blob"" that was subject to conventional thinking about foreign policy.

""We had test-drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like [the anti-nuclear group] Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked,"" Rhodes says. Speaking of Republicans and other opponents, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Rhodes adds that he knew ""we drove them crazy.""

In the piece, he also casts doubt on the moderate nature of Iran's regime: ""I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and [Iranian foreign minister Javad] Zarif are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.""

Rhodes's boss, President Obama, has been a strong and consistent advocate for the agreement with Iran, which requires the country to stop its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. He reinforced the misleading administration timeline in announcing the agreement last July. ""Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not,"" he said then.

Rhodes's freewheeling and cynical comments reminded several White House and national security reporters of an infamous 2010 story in Rolling Stone magazine in which Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and his aides mocked civilian government officials, including Vice President Biden. McChrystal apologized for the comments but later tendered his resignation, which Obama accepted.

The Times article notes that Rhodes is a published short-story writer and aspiring novelist who is a skilled ""storyteller.""

""He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials,"" Samuels wrote. ""He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama's foreign-policy narratives.""",high,test

Even though new players have been incorporated into the team, Dunga has kept his main players from recent teamsheets.

38,"Elderly penguin known for wearing a wet suit dies at California museum

Pierre became famous after scientists made him a special suit to replace missing feathers

A San Francisco penguin who starred in a children's book has died at the age of 33, officials said this week.

The California Academy of Sciences announced that Pierre the penguin, the oldest bird in the academy's colony of African penguins, died recently from kidney failure.

In 2007, Pierre's feathers didn't grow back after a difficult molt. Without his waterproof feathers, Pierre had trouble keeping warm and the other birds in the colony began to pick on him.

Biologists designed a neoprene wet suit for him, and he wore the suit for several weeks in 2008 while his feathers grew back.

Shortly after Pierre, his mate, Homey, and 18 other African penguins were introduced to their new home in Golden Gate Park, in the rebuilt California Academy of Sciences building where the colony lives today. Two years later, the story of Pierre's wet suit was published in a children's book titled ""Pierre the Penguin, A True Story.""

Pierre hatched on February 16, 1983, at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore and was raised by his parents in Maryland until he was a juvenile. In June 1983, Pierre was sent to the California Academy of Sciences with 15 other African penguins to start the new penguin colony.

Pierre had several mates with whom he produced 16 chicks, 27 grand-chicks, and 11 great grand-chicks. African penguins were classified as an endangered species in 2010 and are at very high risk of extinction in the wild, where they usually live 15 to 20 years.",high,test
39,"Capitals are aware of history, but hope they are not condemned to repeat it

They had no choice, over the past two days, but to think the thoughts they thought and say the things they said, because their deeds put them in this situation and their words can't change it. The Washington Capitals crawled off the ice late Wednesday night in Pittsburgh staring at one thing they must confront and one they must ignore: their three-games-to-one deficit to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and their own history of spring failures, respectively.

""Sometimes the road to where you want to go is not always the way you envision it in your mind,"" Capitals Coach Barry Trotz said Friday after a loose practice at Kettler Capitals IcePlex. ""That's okay. That's the blessing of it. Embrace it.

""This group is not afraid of where we're at. We know where we're at. We're realists. But at the same time, we know that we won a lot of games this year, and that didn't happen by accident."" 

The stark reality, prior to Saturday night's Game 5 at Verizon Center: The Alex Ovechkin-era Capitals, an evolving group that first made the playoffs in 2007-08, have never advanced beyond the Eastern Conference semifinals, the round in which they now must take three straight games to win. They understand that a bad game or a bad period or a bad shift no longer means a point in the standings or an early-series deficit. It means summer will be here, far too early.

So in a mostly desolate dressing room Wednesday night, the Capitals searched between wads of tape and sweaty socks for some sort of hope. They flew home that night ""upset,"" according to forward Justin Williams, and then moved forward. As forward Jay Beagle said, without a trace of hyperbole in his voice: ""The most important game of our lives is coming up.""

Most important, that is, until the next one. If they can create a next one.

Though NHL teams with a 3-1 series lead advance nine out of 10 times, the Capitals and Penguins have experience in this exact situation.

""You look at history, a lot of people came back from 3-1,"" veteran forward Jason Chimera said. ""Three-oh's a little different story. ... It's not a mountain you can't climb.""

The view from that mountain in previous years: The Young Guns Capitals of 2007-08, Bruce Boudreau's flying and fearless squad of kids who played with their hair on fire, won 11 of their last 12 regular-season games to take the old Southeast Division title and set up a matchup against Philadelphia in the opening round, Ovechkin's first NHL playoff series. The Capitals lost Game 4 in double overtime to fall behind three games to one, but then took the fifth game at home and the sixth game on the road -- exactly what they'll have to do this year -- before losing Game 7 at Verizon Center in overtime. It now seems like a more innocent time for this team and this fan base.

The following year, the New York Rangers took a 3-1 series lead in the first round over Washington. But the Capitals were dominant in a 4-0 victory in the fifth game, took a 5-1 lead before holding off the Rangers in the sixth, and then advanced on Sergey Fedorov's third-period game winner in the seventh -- arguably the high-water mark for the franchise over the last decade.

In all, Ovechkin's Capitals have played in 15 games in which their season would end with a loss. They are 8-7. And, in a perverse way, they can even draw from last spring, when they took a 3-1 series lead over the Rangers in the second round, then lost three straight one-goal games, two in overtime.

""I think this team have lots of character,"" Ovechkin said immediately after Wednesday's loss. ""Obviously, last year, we were winning 3-1 and we lose the series, so we have to take that experience and turn it around in our way.""

Sidney Crosby's Penguins, too, are plenty familiar with the scenario they now face -- an advantage, sure, but one that could seem a bit uneasy given not-so-ancient history. Two years ago, the Penguins took a 3-1 series lead on the Rangers in the second round, then were blown out 5-1 in Game 5 at home en route to coughing up the lead and blowing the series. In 2011, they had the same advantage over Tampa Bay in the opening round, got destroyed 8-2 in Game 5 and lost the series in seven.

Now, Pittsburgh must avoid that fate against what the Capitals believe is their best team, a team that posted the NHL's best regular-season record but, as Beagle said, General Manager Brian MacLellan ""put together for the playoffs."" Each of the four games thus far has been decided by one goal. A comeback is implausible. It's not impossible.

""I think the focus is going to be on us,"" said defenseman Matt Niskanen, who played on both Pittsburgh teams that blew those leads as well as last year's Capitals. ""And we're going to have to play well to win Game 5, and that's what we're thinking about. Having said that, if we have a good effort and we find a way to win Game 5, it puts a lot of pressure on them in Game 6 to win at home.""

Getting to that sixth game, too, would change not only the deficit the Capitals face, but also their personnel. Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang, suspended for the fourth game for an unsafe hit to the head of Washington's Marcus Johansson, will return Saturday night for the Penguins. Capitals defenseman Brooks Orpik, suspended for three games for an illegal hit on Pittsburgh's Olli Maatta in Game 2, would return in Game 6, should there be one.

To a man, the Capitals professed belief that there will, indeed, be one.

""You got to err on the side of enthusiasm,"" Williams said, ""not apprehension.""

Such enthusiasm will be placed in one game -- the only game the Capitals are assured of playing. They understand the reality of their situation.

""The only thing you can do is deal with the game [Saturday] night,"" Trotz said, ""and we'll see where that takes us after the game.""

That will be one of two places: back to Pittsburgh for a another game, or into summer, where they would be joined by the annual questions about whether these Capitals will ever survive deep into the playoffs.",high,test

Commodity trader and miner Glencore is in talks to sell a further 9.9 percent stake in its agricultural unit, negotiating with bidders that missed out on the 40 percent sold to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Glencore declined to comment.

Bidders include a different Canadian pension fund, state-backed Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Co (SALIC) and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the sources said.

SALIC and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund were not immediately available to comment.

Last month, CPPIB agreed to buy a 40 percent stake in the unit for $2.5 billion, placing the equity value of the business at $6.25 billion. Including inventories and debt, the unit is valued at closer to $10 billion.

The 9.9 percent stake is valued at around $625 million.

Glencore had been aiming to close the deals at the same time in the second half of 2016, the sources said.

""Negotiations are ongoing ... people who lost out are still trying to get on board, but Glencore will struggle to get more money for it,"" one said.

The London-listed company announced its intention to sell a minority stake in its agricultural unit in September, after shareholder pressure to see it cut debt prompted a slew of measures including asset sales, reducing capital expenditure, suspending dividend payments and raising $2.5 billion of new equity capital.

The group said it aimed to cut net debt to between $17 billion and $18 billion by the end of 2016, down from a peak of $30 billion last year.

One sticking point to the deal is whether the smaller stake holder will have voting rights, as CPPIB does, the sources said.

China's health, police and transportation authorities have jointly established a ""green passage"" to ensure fast and safe transfer of donated human organs.

The move is aimed at shortening transportation time and reducing damage or waste of human organs to help patient survival.

According to a Friday circular on the mechanism, police will help ensure ambulance right of way when health authorities receive donated human organs. Airlines should provide priority boarding services and allow planes carrying human organs to depart first.

Health authorities transporting human organs may buy tickets after boarding a train. The Red Cross will also provide help during the transportation process.

It is the second at-sea touchdown for California's SpaceX company, having completed the same task last month.

This latest effort was all the more impressive however because the rocket was carrying much more speed when it made its return.

SpaceX officials have said that recovering boosters used on missions that orbit geostationary satellites will always be more difficult because of the high velocity required to put those platforms in the right part of the sky.

On confirmation of the latest landing, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted the joke: ""May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar.""

The primary purpose of the latest Falcon launch was to orbit the JCSAT-14 satellite.

This spacecraft will relay telecommunications over the Asia-Pacific region for the Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation.

Lift-off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station occurred at 01:21 local time (05:20 GMT).

Separation of the satellite from the Falcon's upper-stage, which is not recovered, was recorded 32 minutes later.

Friday's mission had been delayed a day because of poor weather over the Cape.

SpaceX has now brought back three boosters to Earth under control.

Its first success was in December, when it returned a stage to hard ground close to the Florida launch site.

But it is the ocean landings on special barges that SpaceX is very keen to master. The nature of many of its missions will mean a sea platform is going to be a very frequent return location.

Sending satellites to geostationary transfer orbit requires a lot of performance from the Falcon-9 rocket, and that energy then has to be removed before it can make a landing.

It is not just the extra speed at which the booster is travelling that must be reduced; it is also the extra loading and heating on components that has to be taken into account.

For SpaceX, the goal is clear, however: if it can recover, refurbish and re-fly rockets it should be able to offer its customers lower-cost launches.",high,test

The judge overseeing the Prince estate case has authorized genetic testing on a sample of his blood in case it's necessary to determine who's entitled to shares of the estate.

Carver County District Judge Kevin Eide on Friday granted a request by the special administrator overseeing the estate, Bremer Trust, to hire DNA Diagnostics Center to perform the genetic testing on a blood sample now held by the medical examiner's office that conducted the autopsy on Prince.

Prince died April 21 at his home in suburban Minneapolis. The cause remains under investigation. He left no will.

47,"Convoys Inch South to Safety From Fire-Ravaged Fort McMurray

Convoys of cars and trucks began making their way gingerly through the wildfire-ravaged community of Fort McMurray, Alberta, on Friday, headed south to safety, past the charred ruins of neighborhoods and businesses, after being stranded for days north of town on the area's only highway.

Bracketed by Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruisers and preceded by a military helicopter searching for flare-ups near their route, the first convoy got rolling shortly after dawn.

Ultimately, officials hope to clear thousands of evacuees and their vehicles from the area, which has been cut off repeatedly when flames blocked Highway 63, the only road link to the rest of Canada. Depending on weather conditions and the course of the fire, it may take four days to complete the convoying, municipal officials said.

Officials said no one would be allowed to deviate from the convoy route to check on homes or property. ""The city of Fort McMurray is not safe to return to, and this will be true for a significant period of time,"" Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, said at a midday news conference in Edmonton. ""So the town site is going to be secured and protected by the R.C.M.P.""

When Fort McMurray was swiftly overtaken by a wildfire on Tuesday and the city was ordered evacuated, most of its 90,000 residents escaped south on Highway 63, and the road rapidly became choked with traffic. About 25,000 people headed north instead, to take refuge in the large work camps used to house transient workers at oil sands projects. Some camps that had been mothballed after the recent slump in oil prices were reopened as shelters.

The camps, too, were cut off when the flames closed the highway, and they soon ran low on food and supplies. Officials tried to resupply the camps using a military transport plane, but on Thursday evening, Ms. Notley said that effort was no longer sustainable.

Many evacuees have been airlifted from the camps, using an airstrip owned by Shell Canada, on chartered and oil-company-owned aircraft, including at least one executive jet.

But other evacuees tried to drive south again, only to be stopped at a police blockade outside Fort McMurray because smoke and fire had severed Highway 63. The long line of stopped vehicles led to frustration and sometimes confrontations.

Overnight on Thursday, tankers with gasoline and diesel fuel were escorted north to Fort McMurray to top off the tanks of the isolated evacuees, many of whom had run out of fuel.

The vehicles are being divided into convoys of about 50 at a time, with police cars at the front and back to keep them together and moving. Television images showed that many of the vehicles were pickup trucks fitted with ""buggy whips"" -- pennants on long, flexible sticks that are meant to ensure that the trucks are not overlooked and crushed by the immense dump trucks used in oil sands open-pit mines.

Ms. Notley urged the latest round of evacuees to travel to Edmonton, the provincial capital and nearest large city to Fort McMurray, or else to Calgary farther south.

""What we're trying to do is encourage them to go to the two major centers, because that's where we have the greatest number of services, both in terms of health, income support, mental health support, as well as the capacity to absorb the students into the school system,"" she said.

New shelters were expected to open in both cities on Friday.

Meanwhile, the fire continued to spread. Officials estimated on Friday that about 245,000 acres had been burned, 10 times as much as on Wednesday.",high,test
48,"Shortages of emergency-care drugs are increasing

At some hospitals, posters on the wall in the emergency department list the drugs that are in short supply or unavailable, along with recommended alternatives.

The low-tech visual aid can save time with critically ill patients, allowing doctors to focus on caring for them rather than doing research on the fly, said Jesse Pines, a professor of emergency medicine and director of the Office for Clinical Practice Innovation at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who has studied such shortages.

The need for work-arounds probably won't end anytime soon. According to a new study, shortages of many drugs that are essential in emergency care have increased in both number and duration in recent years even as shortages of drugs for non-acute or chronic care have eased somewhat. The shortages have persisted despite a law enacted in 2012 that gave the Food and Drug Administration regulatory powers to respond to drug shortages, the study found.

For a report published in the May issue of Health Affairs, researchers analyzed drug-shortage data between 2001 and 2014 from the University of Utah's Drug Information Service, which contains all confirmed national drug shortages, according to the study. They divided the drugs into acute and non-acute categories. Acute-care drugs were those used in the emergency department for many of the urgent and severe conditions handled there and include remedies such as pain medications, heart drugs, and saline and electrolyte products.

Overall, the study found that 52 percent of the 1,929 shortages during the time period studied were for acute-care drugs. Following passage of the federal law in 2012, the number of active shortages of non-acute care drugs began to decline for the first time since 2004, but there was no corresponding drop-off in shortages of drugs that emergency departments and intensive care units rely on, the researchers reported.

Shortages of the emergency-care drugs also lasted longer, the study found. Half of acute-care drug shortages lasted longer than 242 days, compared with 173 days for non-acute-care drugs.

Seventy percent of the drugs that were difficult to get were injectable drugs, which emergency departments rely on to a much greater degree than other providers. The most common acute-care drugs affected were those to fight infections, such as antibiotics; those that affect the central nervous system, including painkillers and sedatives; and drugs that suppress or stimulate the autonomic nervous system, which controls heart and breathing rates.

When patients who have been seriously injured and are having trouble breathing come to the emergency department, for example, it's often necessary to administer drugs that sedate them and cause their muscles to relax so that emergency personnel can insert a breathing tube in the windpipe.

""All of a sudden, you have a life-critical procedure and you're using your second-best drug or a drug you're less familiar with,"" said Arjun Venkatesh, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Yale School of Medicine and a study co-author.

Venkatesh said the impetus for the study was his own experience with recurring shortages of such basic but critical medicines as saline intravenous solution while working in the emergency department at Yale-New Haven Hospital.

Patients are often unaware of such drug shortages, and there's no data to show that substituting a preferred drug with one that a doctor is less comfortable with results in patient harm, experts say.

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 contains provisions aimed at stemming these problems, including requiring reporting of shortages by drug manufacturers to the FDA and expediting inspections and reviews by the FDA of alternative products and manufacturing facilities.

The FDA continues to work closely with manufacturers to resolve shortages, said FDA spokesman Christopher Kelly.

""In the past couple of years, numbers of new shortages have gone down, and that's largely due to increased notifications by manufacturers,"" Kelly said in a statement. Injectable drugs ""are particularly susceptible to shortages and can be difficult to solve.""

Changing the economics of these drugs could help, said George Washington University's Pines, noting that profit margins are thin and there's not a lot of extra capacity in the system if one manufacturer stops producing a drug. The Health Affairs study suggests tax credits, rebates or temporary market exclusivity as potential strategies to improve the supply of generic injectables, among other things.

David Gaugh, senior vice president for sciences and regulatory affairs at the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said drugmakers' efforts have helped decrease the shortages, but he acknowledged that more progress is needed. He called for continued communication between regulators and generic drug manufacturers and improvements in the drug review process. ""The only way to mitigate current shortages and prevent future shortages from occurring is a collaborative effort,"" he said.",high,test

50,"Federal Law Officer Suspected in 3 Fatal Shootings in Washington Suburbs

The police were investigating whether the same man, a federal law enforcement officer, committed three shootings on Thursday and Friday, killing three people and wounding three others in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.

The police in Prince George's County, Md, said the man, Eulalio Tordil, fatally shot his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, on Thursday afternoon and then fled. While the police searched for him Friday, shootings were reported at two locations in Montgomery County: Potomac and Aspen Hill.

Mr. Tordil was arrested Friday afternoon in the Aspen Hill area by the Montgomery County police. ""Thankfully, it was without incident,"" Assistant Chief Darryl McSwain told reporters at the site of the shooting in Potomac.

""We do have reason to believe that this incident and the one in Aspen Hill, potentially the one in Prince George's County, was, in fact, related,"" Chief McSwain said.

Officials would not what evidence investigators had of links between the shootings, how they tracked down Mr. Tordil or exactly where he was found.

Ms. Tordil, 44, had obtained a protective order to keep her husband away from her. Mr. Tordil, 62, works for the Federal Protective Service, a police force that guards federal facilities.

On Thursday afternoon, when Ms. Tordil drove to High Point High School in Beltsville on Thursday to pick up her children, her husband followed her, got out of his car and confronted her in the parking lot, the Prince George's police said.

A bystander tried to intervene, but Mr. Tordil shot him, shot his wife multiple times as she sat in her sport utility vehicle, and then drove off, the police said. The man who tried to help her was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive.

The Prince George's police said Mr. Tordil had expressed interest in committing ""suicide by cop.""

On Friday about 11 a.m., three people were shot in the parking lot of the Westfield Montgomery Mall, with one man killed and a man and a woman wounded, the Montgomery County police said. The wounded man was in critical condition, the police said, while the woman's injury was not life-threatening.

Less than an hour later and a few miles away, a woman was shot and killed in the parking lot of a Giant supermarket in Aspen Hill. In the Montgomery County shootings, as in the one the day before, the gunman escaped.

55,"UN humanitarian chiefs in Middle East, North Africa call for bold actions to end bloodshed

The UN humanitarian coordinators in the Middle East and North Africa urged Thursday global leaders to attend the World Humanitarian Summit and take bold decision that will affect change.

In a statement issued ahead of the World Humanitarian Summit, which is to be held later this month in Turkey, the UN humanitarian chiefs said that world leaders must assume their responsibility to find political solutions to end bloodshed, and prevent further suffering, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here.

The UN humanitarian coordinators for Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, the occupied Palestinian territory, Syria and Yemen, said that ""a staggering 55 million people"" in the region need humanitarian assistance to ensure their basic survival, stressing that we all have a shared responsibility to end this tragedy and preserve people's basic dignity.

""Millions of people in the Middle East and North Africa are enduring intolerable human suffering,"" they said in a collective press release. ""Widespread violence, conflict and extremism in Iraq, Libya, Palestine, Syria and Yemen are creating immense humanitarian needs, with the impact felt beyond these countries' borders.""

""In other words, millions of girls, boys, women and men do not know where their next meal will come from,"" they said.

""They lack access to essential health care, whether to give birth safely, receive treatment for chronic illnesses or protect children from preventable diseases,"" they said. ""They are unable to access safe water and ensure basic hygiene. Those displaced from their homes lack adequate shelter, sometimes forced to sleep out in the open.""

Moreover, millions of families ""do not sleep at night worrying about where the next bomb or mortar might fall and whether their loved ones will be caught in the cross-fire between warring parties or bear the brunt of extreme violence,"" they said.

""We have a shared responsibility to end this tragedy and preserve people's basic dignity. Our humanity demands no less,"" they said.

The UN officials said that in the lead-up to the World Humanitarian Summit, they consulted and listened to thousands of voices in the region.

""Their feelings and demands were clear: outrage at the staggering level of human casualties and suffering being witnessed and felt on a daily basis; disbelief in the lack of accountability for clear violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; disappointment in the humanitarian system for failing to support and strengthen local response capacity; and conviction that humanitarian aid cannot be a substitute for political action that addresses the root causes of people's suffering,"" the humanitarian coordinators said.

Calling on global leaders to attend the World Humanitarian Summit and ""make it a success,"" the coordinators said that actions should include listening to the voices of the region and taking the bold decisions that will affect change.

The first-ever World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) scheduled to be held on May 23-24 in Istanbul, Turkey, aims to help displaced people since World War II, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Stephen O'Brien, said here Monday.

The WHS is seen as a platform for heads of state and government, leaders from civil society, the private sector, crisis-affected communities and multilateral organizations, ""to announce their commitments to progress, and also to launch new initiatives and partnerships, and showcase innovative practices and ideas,"" rather than attend just another conference for pledging funds, he said.

A company in Alabama was offering to make an actual, life-size replica of a person, thanks to an enormous 3-D printer, for the cool price of $30,000. That is not, however, their normal business strategy.

If you think of dieting as a long, painful process, new research may change your mind: In one study, researchers found that people who cut calories slept better, were in a better mood and had better sex lives.

For people who were a normal weight or overweight (but not obese), reducing daily calorie intake by 25 percent led to an improved quality of life, found the study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

And yes, it also led to weight loss.

""We found that normal-weight and mildly overweight people who wish to lose weight need not worry about decreased quality of life,"" said Corby Martin, the director of the Ingestive Behavior Laboratory at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana and the lead author on the study. Rather, ""they can actually expect to feel better,"" he said.

In the study, the researchers wanted to see if dieting really deserved the bad rap it often gets for making people grumpy and ""hangry.""

Researchers have hypothesized that calorie restriction ""might negatively affect mood, stamina and libido, and increase irritability, particularly among normal-weight people,"" Martin said, adding that few studies have tested this hypothesis.

The researchers looked at 220 people with body mass index scores ranging from 22 (which is considered normal) to 28 (which is considered overweight). The participants were divided in two, with 145 in a calorie-restricted group and 75 in a control group.

Individuals assigned to the calorie-restricted group met with a health coach who helped them follow a lower-calorie diet. (The individuals were each advised to cut their daily calorie intake by about 25 percent.) They were also provided with food for the first few weeks so they could learn how to follow the diet, control their portion sizes and eat foods that were nutritious and filling. The control group received no dietary advice.

Throughout the two-year study period, the participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about their mood, quality of life, sexual function and sleep, Martin said.

The researchers found that the individuals in the calorie-restricted group reported improved mood and sexual drive, reduced tension and improved general health over the course of the study. In addition, the calorie-restricted group lost an average of about 17 pounds by the end of the study period, compared with almost no weight change in the control group.

The researchers also found that cutting calories did not have a negative impact on sleep; rather, people in the control group reported that their sleep quality decreased over the course of the study.

The benefits of calorie restriction were similar throughout the study, Martin said. While it is true that people feel hungry when they start eating fewer calories, ""other studies have shown that dieting can improve quality of life fairly quickly,"" he said.",high,test

62,"Israel and Hamas using ""rocket language"" again in new escalation

In the worst fighting in almost two years between Israel and Gaza Strip militants, repeated salvos of Palestinian mortar fire were met Friday by Israeli airstrikes deep in the coastal enclave as an escalation between the two sides reached a third worrisome day.

Both Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist militant movement, have said they want to maintain an Egyptian-brokered truce that ended 50 days of war in the summer of 2014 -- an inconclusive fight that claimed the lives of 71 Israelis, mostly soldiers, and more than 2,100 Palestinians, including some 500 children and 250 women.

As each day passes, anxieties grow that a deadly rocket from Gaza or a devastating strike by Israel could set the stage for a fourth war between the belligerents.

The current round of fighting in Gaza began this week when Israeli troops entered the enclave and began to destroy offensive tunnels dug by Hamas along the Israeli periphery.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said Friday that his Gaza government does not want war but will fight Israeli incursions into the territory. Haniyeh said the Israeli troops penetrated a few hundred yards into a Gaza buffer zone in multiple locations.

Using information that Israeli intelligence officers say they gleaned from a Hamas operative arrested last month, Israeli sappers and engineers, protected by ground troops and tanks, have been searching the border perimeter for attack tunnels since Tuesday.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said that his troops will not be deterred by Hamas threats and will continue their search ""until we find and expose every last tunnel.""

The back-and-forth comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a damning report by the state comptroller over his prosecution of the 2014 war with Hamas. The prime minister's office said the report was political.

While Israeli troops have repeatedly ventured into the Gaza buffer zone over the past two years, their presence now has spurred them to action.

""The peace and quiet of the last two years has been a mirage, as both sides have spent the time preparing for the next war, when they should have spent the time securing a more lasting peace,"" said Daniel Nisman, a security analyst for the Levantine Group.

The Israelis have to destroy tunnels that threaten them, and Hamas must respond when Israeli forces enter the strip, he said. Analysts call the Hamas mortar fire and Israeli airstrikes ""rocket language"" -- meaning that it's how Hamas, branded a terrorist group, and Israel talk to each other.

""Hamas can't look gutless,"" Nisman said. ""They're a resistance movement. That's their whole point.""

Over the past three days, Israel says, Hamas has launched 12 salvos of mortar rounds against its forces operating along the perimeter fence. No Israeli soldiers or civilians have been hurt.

Gaza militias allied with Hamas, such as Islamic Jihad, are also alleged to have fired mortars, and their infrastructure -- including a watchtower near the Gaza fence -- has been hit by Israeli counterattacks.

Israel has responded to the harassing mortar fire with tank fire and F-16 airstrikes against multiple targets.

On Thursday, an Israeli missile killed a 53-year-old woman, Zeina al-Amour, in an attack near Khan Younis, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. She was working on her farm when the missile struck, the Palestinians said. Israeli military spokesmen had no comment on the death.

The military wing of Hamas said two tunnels that Israeli forces found over the past three weeks were old excavations used during the 2014 war. Hamas said the Israeli government was looking for ""false victories"" and spreading lies to improve its image at home and abroad.

The Israel military says the tunnels were newly dug and designed for assault.

""Hamas's diabolical plan to infiltrate into Israeli communities must be stopped,"" said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman.",high,test
63,"In Narcisse, Around 75,000 Snakes Are Waking Up From a Nap

A slithering carpet of 75,000 snakes in a space the size of a living room. It's hard to imagine wanting to get close to such a scene, but every year it happens, and visitors from around the world attend the unusual reptilian display in the remote hamlet of Narcisse in Manitoba, Canada.

The peak of the ""emergence,"" as the province's website calls the unusual event, is expected this weekend. Over the past week and a half, guests to the wildlife area have had hints of what's to come. Thousands of red-sided garter snakes have gradually awakened from an eight-month nap in their subterranean limestone lairs. They tumble about the craggy landscape in tangled knots with a singular focus: reproduction.

Over the winter, snakes seek shelter from below-freezing temperatures in limestone caverns in Manitoba's Interlake region. They survive on stored fat, and when the weather gets warm, as it is now, they surface.

""When they wake up literally after eight months underground, I don't know about you, but I'd want to get a Big Mac or a meal,"" said Bob Mason, a reproductive biologist at Oregon State University who studies these snakes. But the first thing on the snake's agenda is sex.

The males pour out of the dens first and wait for the females to slowly trickle out over the course of a few weeks.

""Once she gets up off the floor, she's sort of swarmed by all of them,"" said Doug Collicutt, a local biologist.

In this sea of snakes, a female isn't easy to find, even though she's three to four times bigger. At times, the ratio of males to females is 10,000 to 1. ""Imagine trying to find a slightly bigger piece of spaghetti in a colander of spaghetti, and it's moving,"" Dr. Mason said. So the snakes use scent.

A female secretes pheromones from her skin, luring dozens to hundreds of males that try to court her by rubbing their chins along her back and flicking their tongues. She ultimately decides when she is ready to mate by a mysterious mechanism called cryptic female choice.

The closest male wins and leaves a stinky plug inside her that tells others to back off. She can wait a couple days for the plug to dissolve and mate with another snake, or she can slither off into the swamps to feed and give live birth to her babies in August. (In case you're wondering, the female can store sperm until she's healthy enough to reproduce, said Dr. Mason, who documented a female snake who gave birth seven years after mating.)

By June, there are no snakes at the dens, but they all return in September -- except the babies. Of the 250,000 snakes born each summer, not one can be found in the den that fall. For centuries, some thought they stuck out the winter in giant ant hills, but Dr. Mason believes the creatures freeze and come back to life like wood frogs. He has no evidence, but said he hoped to prove himself right before he retires.",high,test
64,"How forest management helps lay the conditions for wildfires

As flames rip through Alberta, we look at how putting out small fires can help to fuel increasingly catastrophic events as our climate gets hotter and drier

By dousing small, regular fires, forest managers are creating the conditions for cataclysmic events, scientists have said.

Fires in temperate forests are generally increasing in size and area. This is partly because of climate change. Fire seasons in many parts of the world are getting longer and drier.

But equally important in the temperate forests of Australia, North America and the Mediterranean is the way in which we manage fire and forests, said the University of Michigan's Paige Fischer.

These woodlands have evolved to burn lightly and consistently. In British Colombia, the trees tell the story. Blackened rings in their cores show the trees have been singed every 10 to 40 years. Then around the end of the 19th century, with the spread of human settlement and active suppression of fires, the burning stops.

""For most of the last 100 years the main method of fire management has been suppression. This has been effective at reducing fire in many regions,"" said US Department of Agriculture senior scientist, Tom Spies.

In temperate forests where fire has been quashed, the understory grows thick and tall. Flames that are usually restricted to the ground, use that vegetation as a bridge to jump into the flammable treetops. When this occurs, the amount of available fuel increases exponentially. Add in a climate with greater extremes of heat and drought and you have the recipe for a firestorm.

Globally ""countless billions"" are spent stopping forests from burning, according to a recent report. In Canada, where fires are currently ripping through Alberta's boreal forests causing the evacuation of the town of Fort McMurray, the annual costs range between $0.39bn and $0.78bn. In the US, appropriations for firefighting rose from $0.6bn to $3bn between 1995 and 2014 and the budget is consistently blown.

""It's clear that fires are now completely defying our control, no matter how much investment we make in our fire fighting capacity,"" said Fischer. She says a ""huge short term investment"" in fuel reduction is necessary for a long-term gain to stabilise the forests.

At its root, the problem is sociological. Generally people do not like fire of any kind. Controlled fuel reduction burns are unpopular because they create smoke pollution and pose a risk if they escape. Allowing fires to burn naturally is similarly unacceptable. Even in remote areas, some resource managers believe burning good wood represents a waste. The result is that fire, as integral to the forest's life cycle as rainfall, is chased from the woods and the fuel builds up.

""We may have been lulled into a false sense of our ability to control nature during the mid 20th century when climate was cooler and less prone to drought,"" said Spies. ""The other big difference between the 1940s and today is that there are many more people who have settled in fire-prone environments. Fire is returning to many landscapes and increasing - humans are now more likely to be in the way.""

David Bowman, a fire scientist at the University of Tasmania, said: ""Globally we have been feeding the monster and now the monster is feeding itself. Slaying this monster will be difficult.""

""Many communities are blissfully unaware of the existential risk they face from wildfire, erroneously believing fire is an improbable once-in-a-lifetime event,"" Bowman said in a recent op-ed. Mechanical thinning of the understory around homes is now being conducted in Canada, and Bowman called on Australian fire services to similarly stop water bombing and start trimming.

The Australian National University's David Lindenmayer said that indiscriminate fuel reduction burns have ""little or no effect on protecting property assets"" but can impact on biodiversity. ""Our property loss research shows that it should be done close to houses and frequently,"" he said.

The current fires in Alberta are unlikely to have been exacerbated by suppression, said Spies. Boreal forests differ from the temperate forests further south in that they have a longer fire cycle, lots of fuel and tend to burn intensely. But their occurrence in the normally wet month of May is highly unusual and ""consistent with what we expect from human-caused climate change"", according to a local scientist.",high,test
65,"Traders on edge as Staples-Office Depot deal decision looms

Options traders are bracing for wild gyrations in the shares of Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc as the companies await a ruling that could scuttle their pending merger.

Staples, the largest U.S. office supplies retailer, agreed to buy the second-biggest player, Office Depot, in a $6.3 billion deal in February of 2015, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which regulates competition, sued in December to block the merger.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to decide next week whether to grant the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction to block the transaction until an administrative judge can review it.

A decision is expected by May 10, Office Depot Chief Executive Roland Smith said last week.

An injunction could kill the deal since protracted litigation makes it difficult to hold a merger together.

Options traders have pumped up expectations for a large near-term move in the shares.

""Volatility has increased substantially over the last week, but there is no clear indication on which way the ""smart money' is leaning,"" said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global.

The 30-day implied volatility readings for both companies, a gauge of the risk of a big move in the shares, are at multi-year highs.

Based on options prices, Staples shares could swing by about 18 percent in either direction by May 20. The implied move for Office Depot shares is about twice that much.

On Friday, options on both companies were changing hands at a faster pace than normal.

Office Depot calls, typically used for making bullish bets, were particularly active with 48,000 contracts traded, about twice the average daily volume.

These, however, may not be outright bullish bets, said Fred Ruffy, analyst at options analytics firm Trade Alert.

""I think some of these are institutional people positioning to play this as part of a risk arbitrage if the deal moves forward,"" he said.

Risk arbitrage is a speculative strategy that attempts to generate profits by buying the stock of the target company, and possibly selling short the acquirer's stock. Hedge funds often employ options as a low-risk alternative to the outright purchase or sale of shares.

Staples shares have fallen about 38 percent over the last year, and on Friday, were nearly flat at $10.19. Office Depot shares, down about 33 percent for the past year, were up 2 percent on Friday to $6.06.",high,test
66,"Brazil scientists seek to unravel mystery of Zika twins

Scientists struggling to unravel the mysteries of a Zika epidemic in Brazil hope they can learn from cases of women giving birth to twins in which only one child is afflicted by the microcephaly birth defect associated with the virus.

Jaqueline Jessica Silva de Oliveira hoped doctors were wrong when a routine ultrasound showed that one of her unborn twins would be born with the condition, marked by stunted head size and developmental issues.

""When I found out one of them had microcephaly, the ground fell out from beneath me,"" the 25-year-old said as she sat on the sofa of her home in the city of Santos. ""You always hope that they will be born well, thinking that it could be a mistake by the doctor or in the ultrasound.""

Her son Lucas, who she holds in her arms, was born healthy in November. His twin sister Laura, whose head is visibly much smaller, requires regular treatment by a team of neurologists and physiotherapists in nearby Sao Paulo.

With two young children already, Oliveira - who suffered the symptoms of Zika early in pregnancy - knew that life would be difficult with a child with developmental problems. Her husband, the family's only breadwinner, brings home just over 2,000 reais ($566) a month.

""I thank God for giving her to me... I would never abandon her,"" Oliveira said, adding she had never questioned why only one child was born with microcephaly. ""The doctors want to study them so they can see what protected Lucas in case it can help other children.""

Clues To Nature of Disease

Cases of only one twin developing a disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, have been widely documented. Medical research has focused on the interaction between the environment and genetic issues.

Lucas and Laura are one of five cases of Zika twins scientists are studying in Sao Paulo.

Similar cases of newborn twins - one with and one without microcephaly - caught the attention of doctors last year in northeastern Brazil, where the mosquito-borne Zika was detected for the first time in the Americas. The divergence in twins was one reason why researchers began to suspect the presence of a new disease.

Brazil has since registered nearly 5,000 confirmed and suspected cases of microcephaly associated with Zika, according to the Health Ministry. The outbreak, and its impact on pregnant women, has cast a shadow over the upcoming summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on August.

The Zika outbreak is affecting large parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, with Brazil the hardest hit so far. It is likely to spread to all countries in the Americas except for Canada and Chile, the World Health Organization has said.

Last month, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention officially confirmed that infection with Zika in pregnant women is a cause of microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies.

A team from Sao Paulo University studying the five cases believes they may hold clues to the nature of the disease itself and hope to have results from their investigation in a year's time.

""The importance of these twins... is that they could give us some very important answers,"" said Mayana Zatz, director of the Human Genome Research Center at the university.

""How can we explain that one of the twins was not affected: did they have a gene that protected them? Do they have a different genome that disposes them to the infection or not?""

Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. Zatz said the placenta of one twin may be permeable to Zika, while the other may not, barring the virus from attacking the fetus.

Another possibility is that the virus penetrates both placentas but that the neurons of one baby are resistant, while the other's are not.

""The third possibility that we want to investigate is that certain genes predispose the child to microcephaly, and they are altered by the presence of the Zika virus,"" Zatz said, noting that around 15 genes are believed to govern microcephaly.",high,test
67,"Donald Trump Seeks Republican Unity but Finds Rejection

Donald J. Trump's moment of triumph this week quickly gave way to a trying and even humiliating test of his standing as a Republican leader, as a phalanx of the party's most respected figures shunned the man anointed as their presumptive presidential nominee.

Hoping for a moment of party unity, Mr. Trump had scarcely declared victory in Indiana when the cascade of rejection began, starting with the announcement by George Bush and his son George W. Bush, the only former Republican presidents still living, that they would not back his candidacy. And on Thursday night, Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee, said he intended to hold to his earlier pledge not to vote for Mr. Trump, according to an audio recording of his remarks. Mr. Romney said at a private speech in Washington that he was ""dismayed"" by the state of the campaign. ""I wish we had better choices,"" Mr. Romney said. ""I keep hoping that things will somehow get better.""

Mr. Romney's remarks came just hours after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nation's highest-ranking Republican elected official, delivered an embarrassing blow to Mr. Trump, declaring that he had not yet proven himself worthy of an endorsement. In Washington, the announcement was seen as giving members of Congress a free hand to deal with Mr. Trump, without pressure from the speaker to rally around him.

Mr. Ryan's office announced Friday afternoon that it had issued an invitation to Mr. Trump to meet next Thursday in Washington with House Republican leaders ""to begin a discussion about the kind of Republican principles and ideas that can win the support of the American people this November.""

In a Fox News interview Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he had been unsettled by Mr. Ryan's rebuke.

""I was really surprised,"" Mr. Trump said. ""By the way, many other people were surprised by it, and some were really surprised by it, and not happy about it.""

In a separate interview, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, said on CNN that Mr. Ryan should not remain as speaker unless he supported Mr. Trump.

The eruption of hostilities comes at a perilous moment for Mr. Trump, as he seeks to turn toward the general election and woo a larger audience of voters, while taking control of the Republican Party's political apparatus and fund-raising machinery.

Mr. Trump, who won the nomination largely on a message of immigration restriction and cracking down on foreign trade, enters the race against Hillary Clinton, the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party, as a deeply unpopular figure, distrusted especially by women and college graduates, and Hispanic and black voters.

Still, he has collected important endorsements across the Republican ranks, including one from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, and from Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman who hastened on Tuesday evening to declare Mr. Trump the party's presumptive nominee.

But many of the leaders now turning their back on him are among those most trusted by Republican donors, as well as by right-of-center voters most at risk of bolting the party in the fall campaign.

The lurch away from Mr. Trump exposed unsightly divisions in the highest levels of the party: A spokesman for the Republican National Committee acknowledged on CNN on Thursday that Mr. Priebus, who has been advocating strenuously for party unity, had not been aware of Mr. Ryan's plans to announce he was withholding his endorsement.

Mary Matalin, a veteran strategist for Republican presidential campaigns, said it was simply too soon to call for the party to fall in line.

Such a demand, she said in an email, would be ""ridiculously premature, given the discontent among party regulars and conservatives in particular.""

Ms. Matalin said in a television interview on Thursday that she was changing her voter registration to the Libertarian Party, wrote in an email that it was because of her concern about Republicans' abandoning small-government ""liberty principles.""

Republicans say that party officials, including Mr. Ryan, may come around to Mr. Trump as the campaign proceeds. Mr. Trump's unexpectedly swift success in the primaries startled Republicans who expected the race to drag on for at least another month, and perhaps until the July nominating convention in Cleveland.

Mr. Trump now faces abrupt and extraordinary pressure to adapt his political message for a wider electorate, and to begin assembling the political infrastructure required for a general election.

Having financed his primary campaign in part out of his personal fortune, Mr. Trump said this week that he would rely on conventional political donors for the general election. On Thursday, Mr. Trump named a finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, to head up his campaign's fund-raising, and a few of the most prolific donors on the right have seemed to warm to him.

Sheldon G. Adelson, the billionaire casino owner who is a major benefactor of the party, said at an event in Manhattan on Thursday that he would support Mr. Trump. Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, whose family financed millions of dollars' worth of ads attacking Mr. Trump in the primaries, has committed to aiding his campaign.

But division reigned across most of the Republican ranks, as Mr. Trump failed to secure uniform backing from the party's leaders in government. Two senators, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have pointedly declined to endorse him in the general election, and Mr. Sasse has called for a third-party campaign against Mr. Trump.

Several Republican governors have indicated that they will not endorse Mr. Trump, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and, an aide confirmed, Bruce Rauner of Illinois. Mr. Rauner's decision not to back Mr. Trump was first reported by The Chicago Tribune.

And Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, chairwoman of the Republican Governors Association, issued a noncommittal statement on Mr. Trump, saying that she would not vote for Hillary Clinton but that she needed to hear more specifics from Mr. Trump on policy.

A longer list of Washington lawmakers, including Senators Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, have committed to support Mr. Trump, often tersely confirming in emailed quotations that they intend to back the party's chosen nominee. Many members of the House of Representatives have done the same.

Some have declined to mention Mr. Trump by name.

Most Republican campaign contributors face less immediate pressure to count themselves as with or against Mr. Trump, but strategists expect Mr. Trump to face considerable skepticism with donors, whom he castigated as influence-buying plutocrats during the Republican primary campaign.

John McKager Stipanovich, a longtime Florida lobbyist and fund-raiser close to former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, said Mr. Trump would face stiff resistance among the people the party has typically relied for financial support.

Mr. Stipanovich predicted that the stances taken by Mr. Ryan and the Bush family would hurt Mr. Trump with traditional party donors.

""Obviously, Trump has spent an awful lot of time in the last year disparaging people like that,"" said Mr. Stipanovich, who has vowed to oppose Mr. Trump. ""It will be some indication of how craven they are to see how quickly they crawl to him on their knees, or to the party to help him. I don't know that they will do that.""",high,test
68,"Aleppo truce largely threatened with intensified shelling

The jihadi groups have breached the recently declared truce in Syria's northern province of Aleppo with intensified shelling and a wide-scale offensive on Thursday.

The rebels in eastern Aleppo violated the truce just eight minutes after it went into effect at 1:00 a.m. Thursday (2300GMT Wednesday) with two mortars slamming west of Aleppo.

Later in the day, state news agency SANA said the rebels breached the truce with 20 mortar shells hitting government-controlled districts, killing at least three civilians.

The al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front and like-minded groups later unleashed a wide-scale offensive against a government-controlled town south of Aleppo, a military source told Xinhua.

The Nusra offensive started with assorted weaponry and artillery against the town of Khan Tuman in the southern countryside of Aleppo, the source told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.

The Syrian army responded to the attack, destroying a number of tanks, he said, adding that the attack was preceded with heavy artillery shelling followed by the rebels' attempt to advance toward the town from the area of al-Khalidiyeh.

Clashes erupted and various weapons were used, including the heavy ones, he added.

The Nusra Front has announced on its Twitter account the commencement of the battle to ""liberate"" the town and nearby areas with the help of the rebel groups such as Failaq al-Rahman, Ahrar al-Sham, and Nour Addien al-Zunki.

Meanwhile, the source said the Syrian army fired a rocket at an explosive-laden armored vehicle, which was approaching Khan Tuman, adding that another SUV outfitted with heavy machine gun was also destroyed along with its occupants.

It also said that Syrian warplanes carried out several raids on the approaching rebels and their reinforcements near the town.

The military source told Xinhua that the Syrian army succeeded in repelling the attack.

But later in the evening, the rebels renewed their heavy shelling on government-controlled areas west of Aleppo, according to pan-Arab al-Mayadeen TV.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry in Syria has condemned the rebels' breach of the U.S.-Russian-backed truce in Aleppo, saying the ""armed terrorist groups breached a truce in Aleppo that culminated tough efforts to which the Syrian Arab Army has fully committed since Thursday morning as agreed.""

The ministry said that a few hours after the truce took effect, ""the armed terrorist groups shelled the safe residential neighborhoods in Aleppo city,"" adding that ""the crime of violating the truce in Aleppo reveals the real face of the terrorist armed groups.""

""These terrorist groups which are backed by Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries have no other aim but to kill Syrians and destroy their country, yet some insist on calling them 'moderate opposition',"" the ministry said.

The ministry stressed that the terrorist attacks will not prevent Syria from fighting terrorism and working towards a political solution to the crisis through Syrian-Syrian dialogue which will lead to the elimination of terrorism and restoring security and stability.

A day earlier, the Syrian army announced its commitment to observe a 48-hour truce, or a regime of silence, in Aleppo. It came as the city has witnessed intense violence over the past 10 days, during which more than 120 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.

The truce in Aleppo came to bring a lull to the troubled city that has witnessed the most violent shelling from rebels on government-controlled areas. Opposition activists also accused government troops of conducting airstrikes on rebel-held areas in the eastern part of the city.

The ""regime of silence"" has previously been announced to include areas in the countryside of the capital Damascus and the northwestern province of Latakia.",high,test
69,"Italian prosecutor investigates Deutsche Bank over 2011 bond sale

An Italian prosecutor is investigating Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) over its sale of 7 billion euros ($8 billion) of Italian government bonds five years ago, an investigative source told Reuters.

A prosecutor in Trani, a town in southern Italy, is investigating because Deutsche Bank allegedly told clients in a research note in early 2011 that Italy's public debt was no cause for concern, and then sold almost 90 percent of its own holding of the country's bonds, the source said on Friday.

""We do not believe there is a case to answer here and are confident that we acted appropriately,"" a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in an email, adding the German lender was cooperating with Italian authorities.

Deutsche Bank sold the bonds in the first half of 2011 as Italy slid toward a debt crisis that eventually brought down the government of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Italy's economy ministry said in August 2011 that Deutsche Bank had explained the sale by saying it needed to balance out its exposure to Italian debt after taking on more when it bought out Deutsche Postbank in 2010.

Five former Deutsche Bank managers as well as the bank itself are under investigation in Trani, the source added.

The same prosecutor has, in recent years, also opened investigations into ratings agencies Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, saying their reports on Italy and its banks during the crisis were mismanaged and provoked sharp losses on the Milan stock market.

The case against Moody's was dropped before a trial began in Trani last year. The case against Fitch Italia and its country head was moved to Milan, where a judge threw it out on Friday.

However David Riley, Fitch's former head of sovereign ratings, remains on trial in Trani, along with five S&P officials. The ratings agencies have denied wrongdoing.

The U.S. ambassador to Italy, John Phillips, mentioned the ratings agency probe in a speech in Milan last month in which he said Italy's justice system was deterring investors.

In the United States it was ""highly unlikely that such a case would be brought outside the major financial centers, where prosecutors have both jurisdiction and expertise in securities fraud prosecutions,"" Phillips said.",high,test

Two Major League Baseball games that were scheduled to be played in Puerto Rico have been moved due to players' concerns about the Zika virus.

The games between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Miami Marlins have been moved to Miami instead.

Players said they were worried about contracting the virus and passing it to their partners.

Zika is suspected to cause birth defects in babies whose mothers had it while pregnant.

Puerto Rico recorded its first death from Zika last week.

The island has seen more than 600 cases of the virus.

In a statement, Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) said Commissioner of Baseball Robert D Manfred Jr ""had no choice"" but to relocate the games because so many players had partners who were pregnant or trying to become pregnant.

The statement also said baseball would hopefully be played in Puerto Rico again ""in the near future"" and that those concerned would ""continue to support the growth of the game in Puerto Rico, where an outstanding baseball tradition has long made the island an important venue for the game"".

More than 20 countries are reporting cases of Zika, which is spread by mosquitoes.

The country which has been worst affected by the outbreak, Brazil, is due to host the Olympic Games in August 2016.

The authorities there said in February that there was no chance the Games would be cancelled due to the outbreak, and that there was no risk to players or spectators except for pregnant women.

Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said sexually transmitted transmission of Zika is more common than previously thought.",high,test
71,"China to expand bilingual schooling in Xinjiang: Xinhua

China's western Xinjiang region will expand bilingual preschool education, state media said on Friday, a measure that comes amid a broader campaign the government says will promote unity in the region, which has struggled with ethnic violence.

Hundreds of people have been killed in unrest in Xinjiang in the past few years. The government blames the violence on Islamist militants who it says want to establish an independent state called East Turkestan for minority Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language.

Xinjiang officials have said bilingual education needs improvement, referring to a policy that has proved controversial in the region as many Uighurs fear their mother tongue is being pushed aside in favor of Mandarin.

The government says it will improve Uighurs' job prospects.

Xinjiang will use central government funds to offer three years of bilingual preschool education instead of the current two years in the region's rural areas between 2016 and 2020, the official Xinhua news agency said.

""Xinjiang is aiming to ensure 85 percent of pre-school children across the region have access to such education in 2020,"" Xinhua said. The news agency said the figure was 75 percent last year.

The central government has invested more than 1 billion yuan ($154 million) this year to build 552 bilingual kindergartens in Xinjiang, mainly in the region's rural south, Xinhua said.

Rights groups and exiles say one of the major problems in Xinjiang is government controls on Uighur culture and Islam, and point out that few Han Chinese who live and work in Xinjiang make any effort to learn Uighur or make Uighur friends.

China denies having any repressive policies.

Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani has appointed new chiefs for the Ministry of Defense and National Directorate of Security (NDS) or the country's intelligence agency, a statement released by Presidential Palace here on Friday said.

According to the statement the acting Minister for Defense Mohammad Masoom Stanikzai was appointed acting NDS chief to replace Masoud Andarabi who has served as national intelligence agency's chief over the past few months and General Abdullah Khan has been assigned for the post of acting minister for defense.

Stanikzai, who was rejected by the Wolesi Jirga or Lower House of Afghan parliament last year to serve as defense minister, had served as acting defense minister until his appointment to replace national intelligence chief and General Abdullah Khan had served as Chief of Staff in the Afghan National Army Chief of Staff office before he was appointed as acting defense minister.

73,"Despite billions in U.S. funding, Afghan forces have a problem with boots

If first impressions really can be gleaned from footwear, Afghan security forces may be about as disjointed and ragged as a state-run military can get.

As recruits stood in formation here last week, some wore nearly paper-thin black boots one stumble away from an exposed heel or toe. Others had on boots better suited for trekking through feet of snow than standing on sun-scorched gravel. The lucky ones had the same well-padded, sandy-colored boots worn by a visiting U.S. general and his support staff.

""This one, when it gets wet, they are not comfortable,"" said one soldier, Abdul Ali, 21, pointing down at his crumbled black footwear.

The sad state of soldiers' boots highlights something that U.S. military officials have known for about two years: Despite more than $68 billion in U.S. funding for Afghan security forces over the past 14 years, they still can't even clothe themselves.

Because of widespread corruption and incompetence, the U.S.-led coalition has taken control of procurement of uniforms and boots for the Afghan army and the Afghan national police.

Now, the coalition is trying to airlift or ship in more than a million pairs of boots to make sure Afghan forces can properly walk onto the battlefield. Some of the orders for those boots were placed as far back as 2014.

The shipments of boots -- which cost about $75 to $90 per pair -- are projected to total about $100 million through the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The coalition expects to spend an additional $215 million on boots, uniforms and gear for Afghan forces in fiscal 2017.

U.S. taxpayers will be picking up about 80 percent of the tab.

Ken Watson, head of essential functions for NATO's Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A), said the coalition had ""no choice"" but to get into the clothing business to avoid a barefoot army.

In 2012, as the coalition was preparing to withdraw most of its troops from Afghanistan, it transferred to the Afghan government responsibility for the purchase of soldiers' and police officers' boots and uniforms. But the Afghan procurement system was overwhelmed because of widespread corruption, poor management and overreliance on the lowest bidder, often from China.

As a result, Afghanistan became a model for how not to outfit an army.

Thousands of pairs of size 12 military boots flooded into the country, even though it's rare for an Afghan's foot to exceed size 10.

Some pairs arrived with each boot a different size. Even when both boots did fit, they were often so poorly manufactured that they quickly needed to be replaced.

""I've come across boxes of new boots with the soles already split, so we had to take them to the cobbler,"" said Mohammad Zaman Momozai, the police chief of Parwan province.

Getting the Afghan government to handle its own military procurement has been further complicated by President Ashraf Ghani's efforts to more closely scrutinize contracts to avoid fraud, Watson said.

""So we had to go back in.... You just can't stop the flow of stuff,"" Watson said. ""He stopped buying, and that means someone has got to do it.""

While boots and uniforms account for a tiny fraction of Pentagon spending in Afghanistan, they highlight the choices facing President Obama and other world leaders over spending to prop up about 200,000 Afghan soldiers and 151,000 police officers.

At a summit in Warsaw in July, NATO leaders will seek commitments of an additional $4 billion annually for Afghan security through 2020. Western diplomats say the request will be in addition to about $3 billion in annual aid for Afghan reconstruction, which will be a topic at a summit in Brussels in October.

The stakes for Afghanistan are enormous, as the country's battle against the Taliban insurgency shows no sign of subsiding.

According to the World Bank, Afghanistan is spending about 15 percent of its gross domestic product on security. Most Western countries, including the United States, spend less than 5 percent.

Afghanistan -- where the poverty rate has crept up to 39 percent and where nearly one-fourth of residents are jobless -- will be hard-pressed to sustain that level of spending.

But even if the international community keeps pumping in billions of dollars, there is growing concern about monitoring resources as the number of U.S. troops declines.

""The United States military has lost much of its ability to make direct observations, provide tactical mentoring and collect reliable information,"" the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a report to Congress last week.

Shipments of new boots from the United States, for example, are handed over to Afghans for storage in army and police supply depots.

From there, Afghan officials are responsible for distributing them. With CSTC-A officials housed on just four major bases and two smaller ones, Watson admits he's not sure whether all the goods are going where they are supposed to.

""We can't throw and catch and see where there may be problems along the supply chain,"" said Watson, who estimates that 10 percent of the imported uniforms and boots will be lost, resold or stolen along the way. ""The focus needs to be on controlling them to make sure they don't disappear or show up in a bazaar somewhere.""

Even here at Camp Shaheen, the timely arrival and distribution of needed clothing and footwear isn't guaranteed.

""We just received 2,000 pairs of boots, and 50 percent of them were size 12,"" said Col. Christian Walking, a German adviser with the Afghan army's 209th Corps.

That could be a sign that Afghan military leaders are trying to unload old stocks of boots, even though CSTC-A has shipped in 89,000 new pairs since October.

""We don't even buy size 12,"" Watson said.

For the past year, SIGAR has been conducting an audit of clothing purchases. In September, John F. Sopko, the inspector general, informed coalition commanders that preliminary findings revealed that tens of thousands of Afghan troops were not receiving ""cold weather clothing"" such as hats and gloves.

""When they come here, they just receive uniforms and nothing else,"" said Col. Atei Ataoulah, head of training for the Afghan army in northern Afghanistan. ""When they want to wash their feet, they don't have shower shoes.""

The shower shoes will probably have to wait.

For now, the coalition is focused on just making sure good boots get on the ground.

As of earlier this month, just 23 percent of 388,686 pairs of army boots and 29 percent of 572,361 pairs of police boots ordered in 2014 and 2015 had been delivered, according to coalition records.

An additional 245,000 pairs are being ordered for soldiers and police officers this year.

And coalition officials expect they will have to remain in the clothing business well into the future.

Watson noted, however, there is one positive trend.

At least for now, Afghan security forces remain capable of buying and cooking their own food -- although much of the funding for that still comes from the international community.",high,test

75,"Nigeria's president finally signs long-delayed budget

Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has finally signed into law a budget for 2016 after months of wrangling.

He had refused to approve the 6.08tn-naira ($30.6bn) budget amid claims of mismanagement and kickbacks among the officials who drew it up.

The budget triples capital expenditure in Nigeria.

Some 34 projects will get extra spending to help revive the economy, including improvements to power, health, and transport.

""It is a great pleasure to sign the budget. It is a serious article of faith for the Nigerian people,"" the president said at a ceremony.

""The signing of the budget today will trigger concerted efforts to reflate the Nigerian economy, a key element of which is an immediate injection of 350bn naira into the economy by way of capital projects.""

The budget is based on an oil price of $38 per barrel, slightly below the current global market rate of just over $40.

Mr Buhari delayed signing the budget after finding errors in the spending programmes. The former military head of state, who has embarked on a widespread anti-corruption campaign since taking office last May, has claimed some lawmakers removed and replaced spending proposals.

Delays in approving the expansionary budget have added to Nigeria's economic problems of slow growth and high inflation.

In his address, Mr Buhari said Nigeria was ""experiencing probably the toughest economic times in the history of our nation"".

The government is hoping to diversify the economy, produce more food, revive manufacturing and generate employment to help boost growth.

Infrastructure development is also needed, particularly in roads, housing and power supply for Nigeria's 180 million people.",high,test
76,"Harvard Restrictions Could Reshape Exclusive Student Clubs

The all-male final clubs at Harvard University have long been bastions of money, power and privilege. But on Friday, 225 years after the oldest club was founded, the university announced restrictions on the organizations that could ultimately be their undoing, or at least drastically change their character by forcing them to become coed.

Starting with the class that enters Harvard in fall 2017, members of single-sex clubs will be prohibited from holding leadership positions on campus, according to a statement released by the university's president, Drew G. Faust. This would include athletic team captains; many club members have historically been captains. Members will also be barred from receiving the official recommendations required for prestigious postgraduate fellowships and scholarships, such as the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships, the statement said.

The new rules will apply not only to the six male final clubs, but also to other single-sex organizations, including five women's final clubs and nine sororities and fraternities. An estimated 30 percent of undergraduates at Harvard belong to such clubs. Two other formerly male final clubs have already voted to admit women.

Richard T. Porteus, a member of the Harvard Class of 1978 and graduate president of one of the final clubs, the Fly Club, said preliminary discussions were underway with lawyers to challenge the new rules under the theory that they infringe on the right to free association.

""We value what we've created over time and the opportunity that it offers for undergrads to develop as undergrads and, over the course of their lives, as people,"" Mr. Porteus said. ""And we won't abandon it. So whatever legal, moral, ethical means we have of sticking up for our principles, I'm sure we'll consider and choose among. But yes, litigation is certainly not off the table.""

The Porcellian Club, the oldest of the groups, issued its own statement: ""We are disappointed with this unfair and punitive decision that attacks Harvard's own students because they make a choice to freely assemble at unaffiliated, off-campus, private organizations.""

Two months ago, a sexual assault task force said the final clubs raised ""serious concerns"" that required attention from Harvard. Surveys conducted for the university, as well as interviews with undergraduate women, had found that some final clubs fostered an atmosphere of misogyny, sexual misconduct and entitlement.

Harvard is not the first university to take action against single-sex clubs. Fraternities and sororities were banned at Amherst College in 2014, and Wesleyan University announced that same year that it would require fraternities to be coed. Middlebury College is among several other small northeastern institutions that banned such clubs years ago.

Even so, with fraternities at a number of universities under fire as the focus of sexual misconduct complaints, the decision by Harvard could spur other colleges to restrict single-sex clubs.

In announcing the decision, Dr. Faust described it as another step in Harvard's efforts to become a ""truly inclusive"" community.

""Over time,"" she said, ""Harvard has transformed its undergraduate student body as it welcomed women, minorities, international students and students of limited financial means as an increasing proportion of its population. But the campus culture has not changed as rapidly as the student demography.""

The final clubs have a storied history at Harvard. Theodore Roosevelt was a member of the Porcellian Club. Franklin D. Roosevelt was admitted to the Fly Club, also the choice of at least two Massachusetts governors. The Kennedy brothers -- John, Robert and Edward -- were final club members.

Tensions with Harvard date back more than 30 years, to 1984, when the male final clubs and the university severed official ties over admitting women as members. None of the single-sex groups are now officially recognized by the university, according to a Harvard spokesman. The houses of the male final clubs are not on campus property.

Last year, aware of mounting pressure from the university, two of the clubs -- Fox and Spee -- voted to admit women.

Dr. Faust said last fall that she and Harvard College's dean, Rakesh Khurana, were weighing various options to address exclusivity, sexual assault and alcohol abuse in the clubs. And in March, the administration delivered an ultimatum that the clubs should become coed by April 15.

In April, representatives of 13 groups, including the six all-male final clubs, met with Harvard administrators, who had also considered banning the clubs altogether.

That same day, the president of the Porcellian Club's alumni group, Charles M. Storey, wrote in a letter to The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, ""Forcing single-gender organizations to accept members of the opposite sex could potentially increase, not decrease, the potential for sexual misconduct.""

In addition to criticizing many of them as centers of sexual misconduct, the March 8 report issued by the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault said the male final clubs perpetuated a class divide on campus.

The clubs are ""imbued with a certain historical tradition that elevates members' social status on campus,"" creating an aura of sexual entitlement, the report said. ""A woman's physical appearance is often seen as the basis for entry to these spaces, and female students described a general expectation that entering final club spaces could be read as implicit agreement to have sexual encounters with members,"" it said.

Male students who are not members are excluded from parties at many of the clubs, according to the report, enabling ""a gender ratio that makes it easier for members to have a sexual encounter.""

Party themes and invitations have reflected misogynistic views and reinforced a sense of sexual entitlement, according to the report, which also pointed to ""competitive games between members where a man will ""win' a particular woman or compete for the most sexual triumphs.""",high,test
77,"Europa League: Uefa defends St Jakob-Park for Liverpool v Sevilla final

Uefa has defended its decision to host the Europa League final at St Jakob-Park, which has a capacity of 35,000.

The home of Swiss club FC Basel will become the second smallest venue to host the competition's final when Liverpool face Sevilla there on 18 May.

The executive committee of European football's governing body made its decision in September 2014.

""Of course, it is impossible to predict in advance which clubs will reach the final,"" Uefa said on its website.

""Europe's largest stadiums are usually selected to host the Champions League final, and Uefa tends to select slightly smaller, top-quality venues for the Europa League final.

""This means Uefa can give more of its national associations an opportunity to host a club final, and gives fans across Europe the chance to experience a major final in their home nation.""

Liverpool have been allocated 10,236 tickets for the final, with Sevilla given a similar amount.

An additional 8,000 went on general sale, with the remainder taken by the local organising committee, national associations, commercial partners, broadcasters and the corporate hospitality programme.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, whose side overturned a first-leg deficit to beat Villarreal in the semi-finals, said he could find ""30 million people who want to see the game"".

""It is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to play this final but we cannot change the stadium so we cannot think about this,"" he said.

""I have been to Basel one or two times, it is a wonderful stadium and a wonderful city.

""It is even worth going there without having a ticket for the game to be around the stadium and enjoy yourself and enjoy life as a Liverpool supporter.""

79,"""Distracted"" cyclist crashes into BMW on wrong side of road after peeking into luxury hotel at The Shard

London cabbie Kevin Portch filmed the incident outside the five-star Shangri-La Hotel on his dashcam

This is the calamitous moment a seemingly distracted cyclist crashes head-on into a car on the wrong side of the road after peeking inside a luxury hotel.

In the footage, the commuter appears to glance into the five-star Shangri-La Hotel at The Shard, a popular celeb hangout in south-east London.

Seconds later, he collides head-on with a BMW 3-Series, which seems to be parking up outside the hotel, located inside London's tallest skyscraper.

The cyclist, dressed in bright blue biking gear, collided with the vehicle while it was on the wrong side of the road at around 9.15am on Sunday.

Thought to be travelling at around 10mph, he flies onto the bonnet of the vehicle before picking himself up and remonstrating with the driver.

Cabbie Kevin Portch, 53, captured the odd incident on his dashcam.

He said: ""I didn't see what happened live, it was only when I heard shouting that I looked out the window and saw the cyclist and the driver arguing.

""I immediately got called out to a job so I didn't see the end of it but they both seemed to be blaming each other.

""The only reason I could think that it could have happened is that the BMW would be parking up because it is a two-way street.

""If you look carefully, you can just see the cyclist take a quick look in the hotel because you often get quite a few Lamborghinis and posh cars in there so whether that distracted him or not, I'm not sure.""

The taxi driver insisted that the footage had still left him puzzled and was an odd event even for London's red routes.

He admitted that he had not seen an incident like it in nine years of driving around the capital's streets.

Kevin added: ""I've been a cabbie for a long time and you see a lot of things happen on the city streets between cyclists and cars as you drive around.

""But I've never seen anything like it with a car basically at walking speed on the wrong side of the road.""",uncertain,test

The State Department's most senior human rights diplomat, Tom Malinowski, will visit Vietnam next week to urge it to make more progress on human rights, the department said on Friday.

Meetings by Malinowski, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, on May 9 and 10 will pave the way for a visit to Vietnam by President Barack Obama later this month, the third U.S. president to travel to the southeast Asian nation since Bill Clinton in 2000.

82,"Google AI to learn art of conversation through erotic romance novels

Google's latest artificial intelligence experiment involved over 2,000 erotic and romance novels

Having mastered the art of Go, Google's latest artificial intelligence project is to make its intelligent assistant more conversational. To do this, the AI has spent the last few months reading erotic romance novels.

After reading 2,865 of the novels, which include titles such as Fatal Desire, Jacked Up and Unconditional Love, the AI has started to write sentences that are akin to those in the stories. 

Obviously, that doesn't mean that it is writing lines such as ""She glanced down and turned as pink as the lace bra she was wearing"", but more that it is starting to converse in a more natural way. 

According to a Google spokesperson, romance novels are particularly helpful to learn colloquial language because they have predictable themes and plotlines, but use colourful and varied vocabulary to convey them.

The improvements could enhance how Google products such as Search, Google Now and Smart Reply interpret our language. For search, it could improve responses for queries written in a conversational tone, while Smart Reply would help it understand and respond to your emails in a more human-like tone. For Android smartphone assistant Google Now it could help the assistant respond in a more natural way. 

""In the Google app the responses are very factual,"" said Andrew Dai, one of the Google software engineers behind the project, to BuzzFeed. ""Hopefully with this work, and future work, it can be more conversational, or can have a more varied tone, style, or register.""

It is unlikely that we will see a public version of the raised-on-erotica AI, especially after Microsoft had to recall its ""teen girl"" Twitter bot Tay when it turned into a Hitler supporter within 24 hours. 

""We work directly with the product folks on how to develop this with minimal risk of it doing bad things, things that we don't expect,"" said Dai. 

Google's AI could ""theoretically"" write a romance novel of its own, according to Dai, who described it as ""quite sexy"" and ""very imaginative"".

Reminiscent of the film Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with a virtual assistant, Dai admitted it is possible that the AI trained with romance novels could eventually convince a human to fall in love with it.  

Comparing the machine to a statue that a man falls in love with in an ancient Greek story, Dai said: ""If you can fall in love with a statue, I don't see why you couldn't fall in love with a neural network trained on romance novels.""

The changes, which require approval by parliament, call for allowing police to halt people within an 18-kilometer zone around the border and to move all persons who legally entered the country to a transit zone where they will have the opportunity to request asylum. The decision on whether to grant them refugee status will be an expedited one, Kontrat added.

84,"Nailed it: scientists describe weird ancient hammerhead reptile

It was a creature so outlandish that scientists say it reminds them of the fanciful beasts conjured up by Dr. Seuss. But would the famous children's book author have thought up a marine reptile with a hammerhead snout it used to snack on algae?

Scientists on Friday announced the discovery in southern China of new fossils of a reptile from 242 million years ago called Atopodentatus that clarify the nature of this strange crocodile-sized, plant-eating sea-dweller.

When the first fossils of Atopodentatus were found in 2014, scientists thought, based on its poorly preserved skull, it had a down-turned snout resembling a flamingo's beak with a vertical, zipper-like mouth. But two new fossil specimens, described in research published in the journal Science Advances, resolved the matter.

""On a scale of weirdness, I think this is up there with the best. It kind of reminds me of some of the Dr. Seuss creations,"" National Museums Scotland paleontologist Nicholas Fraser said.

Atopodentatus is the earliest-known herbivorous marine reptile, said paleontologist Olivier Rieppel of the Field Museum in Chicago.

Atopodentatus apparently used chisel-like teeth along the edge of its blunt, hammer-shaped snout to scrape algae off hard underwater surfaces. It then quickly opened its mouth to create suction before closing its jaws to filter the plant material through densely packed and needle-shaped teeth much like baleen whales strain tiny shrimp-like krill from seawater.

Atopodentatus, about 9 feet (2.75 meters) long, lived in a shallow sea in China's Yunnan province alongside fish and other marine reptiles, said paleontologist Chun Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.

When thinking of hammerhead creatures, sharks may come to mind. But Atopodentatus' hammerhead feature differed in location and function from the sharks, whose eyes are on the end of lateral extensions on their head.

Atopodentatus appeared during the Triassic Period relatively soon after the biggest mass extinction of species in Earth's history, illustrating that life was bouncing back nicely. Other oddball creatures also swam the seas at the time, including a reptile called Dinocephalosaurus whose neck comprised half of its 17-foot (5.25 meters) length.

""If you saw this reptile (Atopodentatus) in isolation cruising around with some of the fishes of the day, I think you would say it was really quite absurd,"" Fraser said. ""But alongside some of its fellow denizens of the deep, I think it would just appear as one more oddity in a mesmerizing world.""",high,test
85,"Fiat Chrysler CEO: Unclear who owns self-driving cars' data

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Alphabet Inc's Google have yet to determine who will own data collected in their collaboration on testing self-driving vehicles, FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said Friday.

""That's exactly what has to be determined,"" Marchionne said in response to a reporter's question on data ownership. ""We need to get to a stage where the car is viable so we can discuss the spoils of that work. We're not there.""

Earlier this week, FCA and Google announced they agreed to fit Google's self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans, marking the first time a Silicon Valley firm has teamed up with a traditional carmaker to develop an autonomous vehicle.

Marchionne said there are many aspects of the project with Google that have yet to be determined, such as whether the two will develop an open-source software platform that could be shared with others.

Marchionne said that what has been agreed so far with Google is limited, but he suggested that the alliance could evolve.

""The objective of this first phase of our collaboration is very targeted,"" Marchionne said at a news conference at FCA's Windsor plant. ""It's designed to take Google technology into the minivan. It's very, very focused. It has a very clear objective and a very clear timeline. What develops from here, we'll see.""

Marchionne said FCA has been purposely restrained in comparison with other automakers that have bought Silicon Valley companies to speed development of self-driving vehicles.

Lack of clarity over the question of who owns data in a collaboration with Google is one of the reasons most big automakers have refrained from tying up with the Silicon Valley giant.

""It's too early in this process to try and make the call about who is going to end up with sort of the winning solution,"" Marchionne said.

Marchionne said he has noticed ""efforts by others to pre-empt what I consider to be a natural evolution of choices and so making unequivocal bets with companies who are in that space today, and effectively precluding the development with others is a very dangerous bet.""

Marchionne did not name those companies.

In March, General Motors Co agreed to acquire San Francisco self-driving car startup Cruise Automation. Daimler AG, BMW and Volkswagen AG last year bought digital mapping company HERE to accelerate their autonomous driving development.

86,"Canelo Alvarez hopes to extend Mexican holiday festivities with victory over Amir Khan

Serenaded by a mariachi band and festive fans, Canelo Alvarez stepped shirtless onto the scale Friday for what he hopes will be the start of an extended run of Cinco de Mayo weekend fights.

Alvarez weighed in at the catchweight limit of 155 pounds for his first World Boxing Council middleweight title defense Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena against England's Amir Khan, who also weighed 155.

""Great atmosphere, it was a great camp. Now it's time to eat, relax and wait for the fight,"" said Alvarez (46-1-1, 32 knockouts), before immediately retreating to a meal of pasta attended by his father and four brothers.

Former 140-pound world champion Khan (31-3, 19 KOs) couldn't convince Alvarez to agree to a rehydration weight limit, and the challenger expects to weigh at least 10 pounds less than Alvarez at the first bell.

Alvarez, 25, said the crowd at his fights ""keeps getting bigger and bigger."" And as he debuts as a pay-per-view headliner on a weekend previously reserved for greats like Floyd Mayweather Jr., Alvarez's promoter Oscar De La Hoya, and Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., there's a responsibility to cap the enthusiasm with a thrilling victory.

""He must come out swinging and look the best he's ever looked. He's going to take care of business. He's prepared and ready to do that,"" De La Hoya said.

It might help that Khan, who has been knocked out twice and dropped to the canvas on four other occasions, has to deal with the two-division jump in weight, although this fight is under the official 160-pound middleweight limit.

But Khan's trainer Virgil Hunter isn't deceived.

""[Alvarez] is a middleweight. I don't care what anyone says,"" Hunter said. ""The man [has] the belt, don't he?""

That subject has been a touchy one for Alvarez, who insists he feels more comfortable fighting around the super-welterweight limit of 154 pounds.

Alvarez has expressed little interest in fighting unbeaten two-belt middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin, even though there's a WBC mandate to do so if he beats Khan or lose the belt to Golovkin.

""The sense we've received from the public, from the press, is that they want to see Canelo-Golovkin,"" WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said. ""It is a fight that will draw world attention and both fighters deserve such a big event. Now it's up to them to make a deal to make the fight happen.""

Golovkin and his trainer, Abel Sanchez, have said they are not yet willing to move down from fighting at the 160-pound limit, in spite of Alvarez's far larger popularity.

Alvarez's trainer, Eddy Reynoso, was asked Thursday if the next fight will be at middleweight. Reynoso answered, ""Maybe in two or three fights. But now? Not at all.""

But De La Hoya vowed Friday to call Golovkin's promoter, Tom Loeffler, if Alvarez beats Khan and open talks.

Khan is a 5-to-1 underdog for Saturday's fight.

He was bypassed by Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in the last year. But Khan vows he has risen to this challenge and will use his speed and boxing skills to complement added strength developed in nearly a year-long absence from the ring.

""Nobody can dispute what Amir has done going up to middleweight,"" Hunter said. ""He's looking for a challenge. That's him saying, 'I wonder how good I really am.' The great athletes do that.""

""I'm up against a great fighter in Canelo, but with my focus, my hard work, my trainer and conditioning coach, I'm confident I can go in and win this fight,"" Khan said.

Alvarez looked to his fans, some leaning over a high-rise parking lot railing to see him, and told the crowd, ""I know I'm fighting a fast fighter, a fighter who moves a lot, who has a lot of experience; he's world class. But that's why I've prepared myself.""",high,test
87,"Turkish president consolidates more power as PM decides to depart

The abrupt departure of Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu from the office after winning a landslide election in November last year shows how much grip the Turkish president has over the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey.

Davutoglu announced on Thursday that he will step aside after he reportedly had a tense meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who hand picked him as his successor in August 2014.

""As long as (Turkey President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan stays in the power, the question of who will become new prime minister is no longer relevant,"" Murat Yetkin, a political analyst, said.

He said the new chairman of the AKP will be determined by the Turkish president.

For the first time in the Turkish politics, a prime minister is forced out from his office due to an internal squabble within the party rather than a loss in elections or a defeat in the Parliamentary vote of confidence.

""It was not the opposition but rather his own party, his own leader (Erdogan) that pulled the rug from under Davutoglu, unfortunately,"" Yetkin said.

The Turkish prime minister successfully led the AKP in snap polls in November, receiving the support of 49.5 percent of the electorate and securing the majority of the seats in 550-seat Turkish Parliament.

Although he has the mandate to run the nation as the head of the government until 2019, he has decided to resign in a move that was seen as yielding to immense pressure brought forward upon him by the president.

""The fact that my term lasted far shorter than four years was not a decision of mine but it was out of the necessity,"" Davutoglu said in his farewell speech, suggesting he was forced to do so.

Yet the Turkish president told reporters on Thursday that it was the prime minister's own decision to step aside.

The AKP is set to convene an emergency convention on May 22 when it will pick a new chairman of the party and prime minister as well as reshuffle in the top management of the party.

Erdogan and Davutoglu have had a falling out with each other recently when the latter is seen not very enthusiastic about the change of Parliamentary system to an executive presidency, something Erdogan wholeheartedly wishes to secure.

The executive presidency would officially give Erdogan new powers to control the ruling AK party and the government that he has been already enjoying albeit unofficially.

According to Turkish analyst Serpil Cevikcan, last week's decision by the AKP's 50-seat Central Decision and Executive Board's (MKYK) to strip Davutoglu of the powers to appoint provincial party leaders was a signal flare that led to his resignation.

Davutoglu also clashed with Erdogan over the management of the economy and the policies of supposedly autonomous central bank of Turkey, eventually yielding to the policy choices made by the Turkish president.

Both leaders have marked differences in their approach to resolve Turkey's decades-long Kurdish problem and how to improve Ankara's relations with the European Union, especially on migrant deal that was largely brokered by Davutoglu.

Murat Sabuncu, political analyst, believed the failure of Davutoglu in setting up his own team in the government as well as in the top management of the ruling party helped seal the prime minister's fate.

""He has been fully encircled by names [of the people] compiled by Erdogan,"" Sabuncu underlined.

On Thursday, following the Central Executive Board (MYK) meeting, Davutoglu tried to draw a positive picture for his departure, saying that he has no regrets in taking a decision to leave the post.

Yet most are not content with those explanations.

Mumtaz'er Turkone, professor of political science, underlines that the departure of Davutoglu was not based a well-reasoned decision, adding that it will further throw Turkey into chaos.

""Whomever comes next (as prime minister), he will have no credibility other than being a preferred name by Erdogan,"" he pointed out.

Among the names that were floated in Ankara circles as candidates for the party leadership include Transport Minister Binali Yildirim, Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is also the president's son-in-law, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, deputy Prime Minister Yalcin Akdogan, deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus, and Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz.

Only one compromise candidate is expected to contest the chairmanship as it was the case in previous party conventions.

According to Sabuncu, a new chairman of the party would be someone who will not question the president on any issue at all and will fully comply with Erdogan's wishes.

Some believe Erdogan will likely to push for an early election to gain absolute majority in parliament to officially change the regime in Turkey into an all-powerful executive presidency.

Mehmet Altan, an economist and author of dozens of books on Turkey, said the Turkish president plans to hold an early election at a time that will catch the opposition off-guard and give the ruling party more power in the Parliament.

In the meantime, the main opposition Republican Peoples' party (CHP) described Davutoglu's ouster as a palace coup by Erdogan, saying that he was legitimately elected as the prime minister with the votes of 24 million people.

The cabinet reshuffle is expected to follow the AK Party's convention.",high,test
88,"Chinese envoy urges Bosnia and Herzegovina to step up efforts in nation-building

A Chinese envoy to the United Nations Thursday called on Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue to consolidate the achievements in nation-building.

""Bosnia and Herzegovina has in general maintained stability and its economy is turning for the better,"" said Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative, noting that China welcomes the positive developments including those in the area of political process and the rule of law.

Wu told a UN Security Council meeting that China respects the independence, sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and believes that the nation should autonomously choose its own development path and foreign policy.

""China hopes that the various ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to actively consolidate the achievements in its nation-building and fully implement Dayton peace accord, to make even more progress in all areas,"" Wu said.

Dayton Peace Agreement was signed in Paris in 1995 to end three-and-a-half years of war in the Balkans. It creates two entities of roughly equal size, one for Bosnian Muslims and Croats, the other for Serbs.

The envoy noted that maintaining peace, stability and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina benefits regional countries in the Balkans and beyond, stressing that ""the international community should commit to promoting unity of all ethnic groups and harmonious development in Bosnia and Herzegovina, so as to help the nation to achieve sustainable development and long-term peace and stability.""

89,"Maintenance Work to Disrupt Washington, D.C., Metro for a Year

Over the next year, riders on the District of Columbia Metro would cope with sparser service, earlier closings and some station shutdowns under an ambitious plan to clear an enormous backlog of deferred maintenance on the accident-prone, increasingly unreliable system, officials said on Friday.

For years, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has tried to limit maintenance work to nights, when the system is closed, in order not to curtail service. That approach has failed, officials said, contributing to the Metro falling steadily deeper into disrepair.

""We need to do something different, and dramatically different,"" Paul J. Wiedefeld, the authority's general manager and chief executive, said at a news conference. He called the plan ""a massive undertaking"" that would disrupt the commutes of hundreds of thousands of people, but he added, ""I don't think any customer wants us to continue this process where the service is unreliable, unsafe, because we're not doing the basics.""

Jack Evans, the authority's chairman, made headlines this year by suggesting that the system might have to take entire lines out of service for months. The plan unveiled on Friday does nothing so drastic, and officials said that Metro would continue to offer service on every part of its system, but much less of it at times.

Mr. Evans, a District of Columbia council member, said that directors supported the plan. Mr. Wiedefeld said he expected board approval by mid-May, and the major work to begin in early June.

But officials were less clear about how to pay for the effort; Mr. Wiedefeld said he could not even put a price tag on it. He said that some of the money had already been obtained, but that the authority needed permission to spend it in the next year rather than over multiple years. Mr. Evans said the authority's plans require action by Congress.

Washington's subway, which extends into the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, was considered a showpiece when it opened in the 1970. But in 2009, the worst accident in its history, the crash of two trains that killed nine people and injured dozens, cast a harsh light on its deterioration. In recent years, riders have suffered through broken escalators, breakdowns, water seepage and frequent fires caused by aging electrical equipment; there were two track fires on Thursday alone, and a fire last year killed one person.

This week, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a scathing report, saying that the authority had repeatedly failed to learn from safety lapses and correct them.

The repair plan would accelerate years' worth of postponed repair and modernization into a single year, replacing aged tracks, ties and insulators and clearing miles of clogged drains just to get the system to the point that it can keep up with routine maintenance. That will actually lower the cost of the work, Mr. Wiedefeld said, because things that have been done piecemeal can be achieved without daily interruptions. The authority has already accelerated the replacement of its power cables, which he said will be completed this summer, a year ahead of the original timetable.

The plan addresses each of 15 particularly troubled parts of the system with what Mr. Wiedefeld called a ""safety surge,"" lasting a few weeks to a few months, which would have the greatest effect on service. In five cases, that would mean shutting down a stretch of track and a station, and the authority would provide shuttle bus service to bridge the gap. In the other 10 places, the line would be limited to a single track, so that trains could not pass each other in opposite directions, and the number of trains running there would drop sharply.

Systemwide, the Metro will close at midnight on weekends, rather than at 3 a.m. And in certain places, on weeknights it will close as early as 8 p.m. while work is underway, rather than at midnight.",high,test
90,"Berkshire operating profit falls short, book value rises

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday confirmed that its first-quarter profit rose 8 percent, while operating results fell short of analyst forecasts as falling oil prices and coal demand hurt its BNSF railroad unit.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, which has close to 90 operating units, also said its book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities and Buffett's preferred gauge of growth, rose 1.2 percent from year end.

Net income rose to $5.59 billion, or $3,401 per Class A share, from $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, a year earlier.

Operating profit fell 12 percent to $3.74 billion, or $2,274 per Class A share, from $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share.

Analysts on average had expected operating profit of about $2,759 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, before Berkshire released preliminary results at its annual meeting in Omaha on April 30.

Results suffered as falling oil prices and lower demand for coal contributed to a 25 percent drop in profit at BNSF to $784 million, as overall volume fell 5.5 percent.

Freight revenue from industrial products such as petroleum fell 18 percent, and from coal tumbled 39 percent.

Railroad carloadings industrywide fell ""significantly"" in the first quarter, and ""almost certainly will continue to be down the balance of the year,"" Buffett said at the meeting.

Buffett also said insurance results suffered from payouts related to Texas hailstorms. Insurance underwriting profit fell 56 percent to $213 million despite improvement at the Geico auto insurer, which raised premiums to offset rising accident claims.

""Float,"" which is the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and helps fund Berkshire's expansion, grew to about $89 billion from $87.7 billion in the quarter.

Book value per share rose to $157,369 per Class A share as of March 31 from $155,501 three months earlier, while revenue rose 8 percent from a year earlier to $52.4 billion.

Berkshire made two big acquisitions in the quarter.

It acquired airplane parts maker Precision Castparts for about $32.1 billion, and acquired battery maker Duracell from Procter & Gamble Co in exchange for that company's stock. The swap resulted in a $1.9 billion after-tax gain.

Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, posted a 5 percent increase in profit to $441 million, as lower energy costs helped boost margins at its Western U.S. electric utility PacifiCorp.

Berkshire also has dozens of smaller units that sell such things as Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.

The company ended the quarter with $58.34 billion of cash, down from $71.73 billion at year end, largely because of Precision Castparts.

It also owns $106.4 billion of stocks such as International Business Machines Corp, which it plans to keep despite sitting on a $1.5 billion unrealized loss as of March 31.

Berkshire owns 26.8 percent of Kraft Heinz Co, and with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital has a controlling stake in the food company.

Kraft Heinz on Wednesday posted a larger-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost cuts as some shoppers seek out fresher alternatives to its packaged, processed foods.

92,"Mercury is about to pass in front of the sun, and it should be incredible to watch

It happens around 13 times a century: From our perspective, Mercury - the smallest planet in our solar system - will pass in front of the sun. Most of the world, including the United States, on Monday will be able to see the planet as a tiny black dot passing slowly in front of its host star. You shouldn't stare directly into the sun (ouch), but by watching online or using a telescope with a special filter, you can see Mercury in all its tiny glory.

If you have your own telescope, you can watch the event using a safety filter to protect your eyes from the sun. If you don't have a filter handy, you can use a sheet of paper to rig up a safe viewing method - you can project the image of the sun (in the form of a white disk) onto a sheet of paper, then watch the black dot of Mercury crawl across it. You can also check out NASA's websites and social media accounts for live image updates. If you live near an observatory or science center, you should check out their plans - you may be able to pop in and take a peek on their telescopes. Here are some viewing parties in the Washington area.

But why should you care? Because it's a very special event for a very cool little planet.

Mercury has an orbital period of just 88 days, making it by far the fastest orbiter in the solar system. And while Mercury is orbiting, so are we - at a completely different pace. So for our planets to line up just so for us to see the other world sweep over the sun is an uncommon event. This is the first Mercurian transit since 2006, and we won't see another until 2019.

Wait, you say - that's a lot of transits to have in just over a decade. How do we average out at just 13 for every 100 years? Mercury passes between the Earth and the sun every 116 days, but its orbital plane is skewed away from our own by a few degrees. It orbits the sun on a tilted trajectory, by our perspective. So its intersection with our orbit has to happen when it's also intersecting with our orbital plane. That combination of factors makes for some pretty wonky math: There's a pattern to the frequency of Mercury's transits, but it's not as simple as ""every x number of years."" It's more like ""every x number of years for awhile, then y, then z, then y again, and then z three times because why the heck not."" Orbital resonance is weird.

Venus - the only other planet between us and the sun, so also the only other planet that transits from our perspective - orbits much more slowly and on a plane slightly less skewed than Mercury's. Venusian transits are more rare, but also a little easier to keep track of: They happen in pairs separated by eight years, with each pair separated from the next by a century and some change. If you missed the 2012 transit, you're out of luck. The next one isn't coming until 2117.

Transits outside our own neighborhood are pretty cool, too: We use the transits of exoplanets in front of their host stars to detect their presence, and even to measure them and analyze their atmospheres for signs of habitability.

Now that we've got the orbital positions of our neighboring planets down pat, transits aren't the grand scientific opportunities they used to be.

""Scientifically, this was much more important a few hundred years ago,"" Nancy Chabot, who served as lead imaging scientist for NASA's MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging mission (MESSENGER), told The Washington Post. The MESSENGER spacecraft wrapped up its mission last year when it crashed down onto Mercury's surface.

But scientists can still get something out of the transit. They'll be able to analyze Mercury's scant atmosphere - the thinnest in the entire solar system - in the same way that scientists use the passage of light through molecules in exoplanet atmospheres to search for signs of life. They can even use the event to calibrate instruments on spacecraft, because the timing and positioning of Mercury's transit over the sun's surface is so reliable. Telescopes can be pointed in the right direction based on Mercury's placement, and some instruments can even correct their vision based on the event.

""It's like getting a cataract -- you see stars or halos around bright lights as though you are looking through a misty windshield,"" NASA scientist Dean Pesnell said in a statement. Mercury should appear totally black against the sun's light, but the way instruments scatter light may cause it to look slightly lit up. Scientists can use the event to try to retune those instruments to see Mercury in its true colors, which could prevent mishaps when observing more mysterious objects.

Chabot hopes the event will inspire the public to look up into the sky and think about our planetary neighbors. On Friday, she and the rest of the MESSENGER team released the first ever complete topographic map of Mercury.

""It's really well-timed,"" she said. ""People will be looking.""

Her team learned plenty of fascinating things about Mercury during the mission. Chabot said she ""didn't want to pick favorites"" but found three features to be particularly intriguing:

""One is that it's got these giant areas of volcanic lava that have flowed across the surface in ancient times, which takes up an area more than half the size of the U.S. The epic volcanic events that must have occurred to cause that are intriguing,"" she said.

Mercury also has features called ""hallows"" that have never been seen anywhere else. The small depressions appear to be spots where rocks - ones unable to stand up to Mercury's environment - sublimate away like snow on a warm day.

""Rocks don't usually just disappear into space, but they do on Mercury,"" Chabot said.

Chabot spent most of her time focusing on the water ice that forms at Mercury's north and south poles, which are permanently shadowed. Finding it there was great, she said, but it raises new questions. How did it get there, when, and what might it tell us about how water found its way to Earth?

""You answer one thing in science, and you're left with all these intriguing new questions,"" she said.

Seeing Mercury as a tiny dot in front of the sun isn't going to answer any of those questions - or even allow you to see those alien features. But you should still consider checking it out.",high,test

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for a seventh week in a row to the lowest level since October 2009, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said Friday, although as analysts see an end to the nearly two-year slump in drilling for new wells.

Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to May 6, bringing the total rig count down to 328, that compares with the 668 rigs operating a year ago, Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report.

In 2015, drillers cut on average 18 oil rigs per week for a total of 963 for the year, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988 amid the biggest rout in crude prices in a generation.

Before this week, drillers cut on average 12 oil rigs per week for a total of 204 so far this year.

The U.S. rig count may finally be bottoming out as companies look for oil prices to rally just a bit more, a signal that the time has come to deploy more capital and get production moving again, analysts say.

Energy firms have sharply reduced oil and gas drilling since the collapse in crude markets began in mid-2014 when U.S. crude futures fell from over $107 a barrel to hit a near 13-year low at around $26 in February.

After climbing to a six-month high around $47 last week, U.S. crude futures this week were heading for their first weekly loss in four weeks, trading around $45 as investors cash in on the prior month's gains. [O/R]

U.S. crude futures were fetching about $46 for the balance of 2016 and about $48 for calendar 2017.

With prices expected to rise in the future, at least one company announced plans to return to the pad as soon as this month.

Concho Resources Inc this week said will add two rigs in the Midland Basin in West Texas in May. Analysts at Cowen & Co said in a note that Concho planned to add two more rigs in June.

In the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, drillers this week added five oil rigs, the first weekly increase so far this year.

Cowen said it expect U.S. oil and gas land rigs to bottom near current levels between 375 and 400 sometime in the second quarter before increasing in the fourth quarter. The total land rig count fell by three this week to 388, according to Baker Hughes.

97,"News Analysis: Political interference risks undermining Asia's growth potential

Negotiations for the 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) have progressed further as trade and investment opportunities in the dynamic Asia Pacific region expend, though questions remain about its comprehensiveness.

Australian Minister for Trade and Investment, Steven Ciobo told Xinhua in a statement on Friday though RCEP negotiations are complex given the diversity of countries and issues involved, negotiations on market access and stronger trade-based rules have progressed.

""RCEP negotiators also engaged with business and other stakeholders across a broad range of issues, including non-tariff measures (NTMs), e-commerce, intellectual property and investor state dispute settlement,"" Ciobo said.

The RCEP, encompassing the 10-member ASEAN plus China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand, is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, ensuring Asia meets its potential as the dynamic driver of global growth via deeper integration and structural reforms.

But an agreement can only be signed when the diverse region agrees to market access commitments that eliminate at least 95 percent of tariffs, removing unnecessary barriers to foreign investment and measures to constrain non-tariff trade restrictions.

Trade analysts predict the RCEP will not be as comprehensive as expected as regional trade blocks become politically charged following the failed Doha round of global trade negotiations that stumbled because complex issues could not be resolved.

""I can't see some developing countries like Malaysia, Indonesia for instance to give up all their protectionism at the expense of free trade,"" Director of the Institute of Global Finance at University of New South Wales Fariborz Moshirian told Xinhua.

""Similarly, countries like New Zealand and Australia will be sensitive about some sectors of the economy, and of course having Japan on side, Japan itself will have a hair roll when it comes to agriculture.""

In an ideal world these negotiations would progress in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) where decisions are economically, not politically, driven.

What also cannot be discounted is the influence of the United States which sees the RCEP as a treaty designed to offset the U.S.-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). It is playing an important role in the outcome of the negotiations, Moshirian said.

""It might not be as simple as it looks,"" he said.

U.S. President Barack Obama has been pushing for the U.S. Congress to approve the 12-member TPP, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Malaysia among others, in a bid to ""call the shots"" on trade with Asia.

""China is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk,"" Obama wrote in a Washington Post editorial on Monday.

A successful RCEP deal and China's welcoming attitude toward the TPP have created the bedrock for a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) which is in its preliminary stages at the Asia-Pacific Economic Ccoperation (APEC).

Should FTAAP progress further, geopolitical tensions should not be underestimated as APEC also incorporates Russia, Moshirian said.

Nearly one in three women over age 65 in Canada's province of British Columbia received inappropriate prescription drugs in 2013, according to a study released by the University of British Columbia (UBC) on Thursday.

""The effect of a patient's sex on the risk of inappropriate prescribing is of tremendous clinical and social concern,"" said Steve Morgan, professor at UBC's School of Population and Public Health and principal investigator of the study.

The work analyzed population-based health-care datasets to find out which medical and non-medical factors influence patients' risk of receiving prescription medicines on the American Geriatrics Society's list of drugs that should be avoided for older patients. The biggest non-medical risk factor was an individual's sex.

The authors found that, even when results were adjusted for all other risk factors, women were as much as 23 percent more likely than men to be prescribed inappropriate drugs.

""Being a woman is double jeopardy when it comes to taking medications. Women metabolize drugs differently than men. Gender roles and social circumstances also place them at risk,"" said Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, scientific director of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Gender and Health.

""However, I expect that by empowering women with knowledge about the harms of sleeping pills and other medications, we can help drive decisions to try switching to safer therapies,"" she said.

Researchers concluded that the sex differences in older adults' risk of receiving a potentially inappropriate prescription are significantly influenced by social dynamics, including differences in patients' care seeking behaviors, as well as differences in the relationships and communications between patients and prescribers.

An independent review is to be carried out into an agreement aimed at protecting remaining bank branches in towns and villages.

The industry-wide protocol, signed in March 2015, requires banks to investigate alternative arrangements before closing the last bank in town.

Those options included free-to-use cash machines, banks on wheels and the use of local Post Office branches.

The review is expected to report by the end of the year.

It will led by Professor Russel Griggs, who previously reviewed the major banks' lending code.

""It is vital that the protocol meets its aim of minimising the impact of bank branch closures on customers and local communities,"" he said.

""This review will not only be looking at how the processes behind the protocol are working in practice, but also crucially the outcomes that they are delivering.""

Checks

Before the protocol was signed there was a voluntary agreement to assist vulnerable customers when towns and villages become bank-free.

Banks should now consider the proximity of alternative branches as part of a 12-week consultation before a closure. Proximity can be very different, depending on the mobility of customers, ranging from young car drivers to older people reliant on public transport, so the age profile of the branch's customers will be part of the review.

Under the current agreement, signed by banks, the government and consumer groups, there is no punishment if banks fail to provide alternatives when the last branch closes.

The Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS) says many hundreds of communities in the UK have lost all their banks.

Derek French, from the campaign, said: ""In practice the protocol, and the necessary published impact statements, are proving to be of little value to communities suffering branch closures as they deal only with post-closure provision.

101,"Inner Peace? The Dalai Lama Made a Website for That

The Dalai Lama, who tirelessly preaches inner peace while chiding people for their selfish, materialistic ways, has commissioned scientists for a lofty mission: to help turn secular audiences into more self-aware, compassionate humans.

That is, of course, no easy task. So the Dalai Lama ordered up something with a grand name to go with his grand ambitions: a comprehensive Atlas of Emotions to help the more than seven billion people on the planet navigate the morass of their feelings in order to attain peace and happiness.

""It is my duty to publish such work,"" the Dalai Lama said.

To create this ""map of the mind,"" as he called it, the Dalai Lama reached out to a source Hollywood had used to plumb the inner workings of the human psyche.

Specifically, he commissioned his good friend Paul Ekman -- a psychologist who helped advise the creators of Pixar's ""Inside Out,"" an animated film set inside a girl's head -- to map out the range of human sentiments. Dr. Ekman later distilled them into the five basic emotions depicted in the movie, from anger to enjoyment.

Dr. Ekman's daughter, Eve, also a psychologist, worked on the project as well, with the goal of producing an interactive guide to human emotions that anyone with an Internet connection could study in a quest for self-understanding, calm and constructive action.

""We have, by nature or biologically, this destructive emotion, also constructive emotion,"" the Dalai Lama said. ""This innerness, people should pay more attention to, from kindergarten level up to university level. This is not just for knowledge, but in order to create a happy human being. Happy family, happy community and, finally, happy humanity.""

The Dalai Lama paid Dr. Ekman at least $750,000 to develop the project, which began with a request several years ago.

""When we wanted to get to the New World, we needed a map,"" Dr. Ekman recalled the Dalai Lama telling him. ""So make a map of emotions so we can get to a calm state.""

As a first step, Dr. Ekman conducted a survey of 149 scientists (emotion scientists, neuroscientists and psychologists who are published leaders in their fields) to see where there was consensus about the nature of emotions, the moods or states they produce, and related areas.

Based on the survey, Dr. Ekman concluded that there were five broad categories of emotions -- anger, fear, disgust, sadness and enjoyment -- and that each had an elaborate subset of emotional states, triggers, actions and moods. He then took these findings to a cartography and data visualization firm, Stamen, to depict them in a visual and, hopefully, useful way.

""If it isn't fun, it's a failure,"" Dr. Ekman said. ""It's got to be fun for people to use.""

Stamen's founder, Eric Rodenbeck, has created data visualizations for Google, Facebook and MTV, as well as maps showing climate change and rising oceans. But he said the Atlas was the most challenging project he had ever worked on because it was ""built around knowledge and wisdom rather than data.""

Not surprisingly, getting scientists to reach a unified understanding of human emotions was difficult.

Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, also counseled Pixar on establishing and depicting the emotional characters for ""Inside Out."" He has even advised Facebook on its emoticons.

While Dr. Keltner took part in Dr. Ekman's survey, the two are not in complete agreement on the number of core emotions. Dr. Keltner said that the findings the Atlas was based on were not without flaws, but that he saw the project as a good step.

""The survey questions could have allowed for more gray areas,"" he said. ""But it's important to take stock of what the scientific consensus is in the field.""

Dr. Ekman emphasized that the Atlas was not a scientific work intended for peer review.

""This is not a science project,"" he said. ""It is a visualization for what we think has been learned from scientific studies. It's a transformative process, a work of explanation.""

Whether science project or tool for self-enlightenment, the Dalai Lama wants to keep religion out of it.

""If we see this research work as relying on religious belief or tradition, then it automatically becomes limited,"" he said. ""Even if you pray to God, pray to Buddha, emotionally, very nice, very good. But every problem, we have created. So I think even God or Buddha cannot do much.""

The Dalai Lama said he hoped the Atlas could be a tool for cultivating good in the world by defeating the bad within us.

""Ultimately, our emotion is the real troublemaker,"" he said. ""We have to know the nature of that enemy.""

The Dalai Lama said he had been encouraged by President Obama's reaction to the project when he told him about it in India.

""Obama seems, I think, to show more interest about our inner value,"" he said. ""In the past, compassion was something of a sign of weakness, or anger a sign of power, sign of strength. Basic human nature is more compassionate. That's the real basis of our hope.""

While excited about the Atlas, however, the 80-year-old Dalai Lama will probably not be clicking around the interactive site. He is much more comfortable turning the printed pages of a version that was custom-made for him.

102,"Gold jumps after U.S. payrolls data misses forecasts

Gold jumped 1 percent on Friday after U.S. non-farm payrolls data for April came in weaker than expected, boosting expectations the Federal Reserve will delay further interest rate increases.

Bullion prices pared gains later in the session as the U.S. dollar turned higher against a basket of major currencies and New York Fed President William Dudley told the New York Times that two rate hikes in 2016 remain a ""reasonable expectation.""

The Labor Department report showed the U.S. economy added 160,000 jobs in April, the fewest in seven months, and Americans dropped out of the labor force in droves, signs of weakness that cast doubts on whether the Fed will lift rates before the end of the year.

Spot gold hit a high of $1,295.70 an ounce after the data and was up 0.8 percent at $1,287.51 an ounce at 2:48 p.m. EDT (1848 GMT). It was on track to close the week down 0.5 percent in sharp contrast to last week's biggest increase since early February.

U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up 1.7 percent at $1,294 an ounce.

Spot prices are up 21 percent this year on expectations the Fed will delay further rate hikes. Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

""The report won't satisfy the Fed's criteria for hiking rates in June and is another disappointment for markets,"" said Royce Mendes, director and senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto, in a note.

""With consumption expected to rebound in the second quarter, the Fed should be in a position to raise rates again in September.""

U.S. short-term interest rate futures contracts rose after the payrolls data, suggesting traders see a better chance the Fed will wait longer to act.

""Anybody who was thinking there was going to be a June rate hike is probably going to be disappointed,"" Citi analyst David Wilson said.

Stock markets worldwide dipped after the data, which added to economic growth concerns, and short-dated Treasury yields sank.

Investor sentiment toward gold showed signs of optimism. Assets of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to the highest in over two years on Thursday at 829.44 tonnes.

103,"Aussie vitamin maker plans expansion into China's herbal medicine market

Australian pharmaceutical company Blackmores will attempt to tap into the burgeoning herbal medicine market in China and throughout Asia via its new Australian-based business.

The vitamin maker on Friday announced it had acquired leading local Chinese medicine manufacturer and distributor Global Therapeutics, a group that currently commands an estimated 80 percent share of the Chinese herbal remedy market in Australia, for 17 million U.S. dollars.

Global Therapeutics, based out of the coastal city of Byron Bay, has two main brands Fusion and Oriental Botanicals which are currently only sold in Australia.

But with the Chinese natural-remedy market said to be worth 125 million U.S. dollars worldwide per annum, Blackmores' chief executive Christine Holgate said the group would look to push into the world's most populous country, China.

""It's not going to happen overnight but there is a fantastic opportunity,"" Holgate told Fairfax Media on Friday.

""It will enable us to better understand the Chinese consumer and get closer to them.""

Last year, the Federal government removed its pre-existing 4-6 percent tariff on Australian pharmaceutical exports, such as vitamins, to China by signing the Chinese-Australian Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA).

By 2019, 95 percent of Australian healthcare exports must be tariff-free to satisfy the terms of the historic document.

In the past 12 months alone, Global Therapeutics' domestic sales have increased by 24 percent, Holgate said.

Holgate said Australia currently has more than 4,700 registered Chinese medicine practitioners, and the market showed no signs of slowing down.

Despite Blackmores' success on the Australian Stock Exchange, largely stemming from the massive demand in China for its ""clean and green"" vitamin products, Holman said there was still room for improving its range.

Holgate said Blackmores' upper management had identified natural remedies as one of the company's biggest weaknesses.

""It's the natural medicine part we've not been strong in,"" she said on Friday.

Asian buyers now make up around 50 percent of Blackmores' total sales, a figure that could likely expand through exporting Fusion and Oriental Botanicals.

Blackmores has no plans to rebrand the Fusion and Oriental Botanicals for the Chinese market, Holgate said.",high,test

When Moqtada al-Sadr called on his followers to fight against the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq following the 2003 invasion, they obliged to devastating effect. His militiamen launched thousands of attacks on U.S. soldiers. Their notorious roadside bombs killed and maimed.

Now, he has turned his sights to Iraq's corrupt halls of power, and the dramatic storming of Baghdad's fortified Green Zone last week by his followers has shaken Iraq's political system.

It has dramatically ramped up pressure on Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to implement reforms he has promised.

But it has also caused a backlash against the rabble-rousing cleric -- some politicians accuse him of holding the country to ransom and using his call for reform for the purpose of increasing his personal influence.

It has deepened divides in Iraq's Shiite community, and new blast walls were erected on bridges around the Green Zone on Friday by a premier desperate to prove his mettle after the breach that undermined his credibility.

But it has also caused a backlash against the rabble-rousing cleric -- some politicians accuse him of holding the country to ransom and using his call for reform for the purpose of increasing his personal influence.

It has deepened divides in Iraq's Shiite community, and new blast walls were erected on bridges around the Green Zone on Friday by a premier desperate to prove his mettle after the breach that undermined his credibility.

He espouses a strong Arab nationalist platform, and presents himself as a champion of the downtrodden impoverished Shiite masses, from where he draws most support.

Although Iraq is deeply divided along Sunni-Shiite lines, the tension within the Shiite community is driving the current crisis.

""Out, out Iran,"" Sadr's supporters had chanted as they gathered in the Green Zone, after ransacking parliament. They had also turned on Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian commander who has led efforts against the Islamic State, both in Iraq and Syria.

""America and Iran have split the cake of Iraq between them, and each is having their share,"" said Salah Hassan, a 33-year-old fighter with Sadr's militia, the Peace Brigades. ""People say the Shiites are loyal to Iran, but we are only loyal to Sadr.""

As Sadr's followers stormed the Green Zone, his militiamen took position around its perimeter. In response, the Khorasani Brigades, an Iranian proxy militia, and others closer to Tehran, deployed heavily on the streets of Baghdad. Other militias close to Iran pulled fighters back from the country's conflict zones.

""It's not outside the realms of possibility for them to turn their guns on each other,"" Khoei said.

The Peace Brigades, a reformation of the notorious Mahdi Army that waged war against U.S. soldiers in 2004, is at the heart of Sadr's power. Its members are die-hard and have clashed with the state in the past.

In 2008, then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki launched the ""Charge of the Knights"" against his Mahdi Army in the city of Basra, in an attempt to wrest control of it from the militia. Then, it was Iran that eventually brokered a cease-fire agreement, and some hope that Iraq's neighbor can step in to rein in Sadr once more.

""Iran has the same point of view as America, that Iraq should be stable. Stability is very important now,"" said Salah Abdul Razzaq, a Shiite politician and former governor of Baghdad. Iran should play a mediation role, he said.

A day after his supporters packed up and left their short-lived sit-in, Sadr got on a plane and left for Iran.

His office said it was a personal trip to visit an Iranian shrine, despite coming at a time when thousands of Shiites stream to a shrine in Baghdad to pay their respects on the anniversary of the death of an 8th-century imam, a pilgrimage he missed.

The Iraqi rumor mill swirled into action, with some politicians speculating he was summoned by a furious Tehran.

""I think they are angry, maybe they blame him for what happened,"" Abdul Razzaq said.

Five days later, he has still not returned, and before his departure, he had announced a two-month spiritual retreat. His supporters have remained stoic.

""Everyone should be comforted that even if Sadr stayed in Iran for half a century, he would not be subjected to any pressure or do anything against Iraq's interests,"" Dia al-Asadi, a politician with Sadr's political bloc, said in a statement last week.

But he distanced Sadr from the anti-Iranian chants, saying the cleric was against them.

There have been other small signs of conciliation from Sadr's camp, most notably on Friday, when a directive from the cleric's office ordered protests to be held locally around mosques after prayers, rather than in a mass gathering in Baghdad.

The apparent downscale gives some breathing space for Abadi, who is desperately trying to steer Iraq out of its crisis. At the center of Sadr's demands is a new technocratic government, a policy of Abadi himself. But despite embarking on a radical reform program last summer to cut government waste and corruption, Abadi's success has been limited. Change involves upsetting a status quo that Iraq's political elite currently benefits from, and few expect them to let go easily.

Abadi was already seen as a weak leader, and Sadr's actions have undermined him further, with members of parliament incensed by the breach of their fortified inner sanctum.

As he attempts to regain control, and credibility, he has pledged to prevent another breach and fired the head of Green Zone security, who kissed Sadr's hand as the cleric entered the area in March.

New blast walls have been erected on the bridges that cross the Tigris to the Green Zone.

But the Sadrists have promised to escalate and call for the prime minister's resignation if a new technocratic government is not created. With parliament splintered, even getting enough members together to hold a session and vote will be a challenge. The Kurds are refusing to attend, while a group of rebel parliamentarians refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the speaker.

Just how long Sadr will wait before ratcheting up pressure remains to be seen.

105,"We Know You Hate ""Moist."" What Other Words Repel You?

Moist. Luggage. Crevice. Stroke. Slacks. Phlegm.

How did those words make you feel?

Certain everyday words drive some people crazy, a phenomenon experts call ""word aversion."" But one word appears to rise above all others: ""moist."" For that reason, a recent paper in the journal PLOS One used the word as a stand-in to explore why people find some terms repellent.

""It doesn't really fit into a lot of existing categories for how people think about the psychology of language,"" the study's author, Paul Thibodeau, a professor of psychology at Oberlin College, said of moist. ""It's not a taboo word, it's not profanity, but it elicits this very visceral disgust reaction.""

A little less than a quarter of the approximately 2,500 unique subjects tested in Mr. Thibodeau's five experiments over four years had trouble dealing with any appearance of the word.

When asked to react to moist in a free-association task, about one-third of those people responded with ""an expression of disgust,"" Mr. Thibodeau said. Almost two-thirds of those who later reported an aversion were so bothered by ""moist"" that they could recall its inclusion among a set of 63 other words -- an unusually high rate.

The peer-reviewed study attempted to explain why moist had become the linguistic equivalent of nails on a chalkboard for some people.

Words that sound similar -- including hoist, foist and rejoiced -- did not put off participants in the same way, suggesting that aversion to the word was not based on the way it sounds. But people who were bothered by moist also found that words for bodily fluids -- vomit, puke and phlegm -- largely struck a nerve. That led Mr. Thibodeau to conclude that for those people moist had taken on the connotations of a bodily function.

It has long been acknowledged that many people are cursed with moist phobia. In 2007, a linguistics professor from the University of Pennsylvania, Mark Liberman, wrote about moist in exploring the concept of word aversion. In 2012, the word came up again, after The New Yorker asked readers which ones they would eliminate from the English language. Mr. Thibodeau's study cites People magazine's 2013 attempt to have some of its ""sexiest men"" make ""the worst word sound hot!""

But Jason Riggle, a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago, said the excessive focus on moist might have made it a broader understanding of word aversion more difficult.

""Moist has become such a flagship word for this, and the fact that so many people talk about it now makes it harder to get a handle on"" word aversion more generally, he said.

That may help explain why other recent studies on word aversion, unlike Mr. Thibodeau's, found a close link between a word's phonological properties -- its combination of sounds -- and people's reactions.

David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at the Baylor College of Medicine whose lab has conducted its own experiments into word aversion over the past year, found that an unusual combination of sounds in a group of made-up words was more likely to put people off than several other factors. A study at Colby College last year also suggested that a word's phonological properties could repel people.

Dr. Eagleman suspects that word aversion is similar to synesthesia, the blending of senses in which an aural phenomenon, such as a musical note, can trigger a visual or even an emotional response. He suggested that the process through which a specific combination of sounds evokes disgust might be similar.

""There appears to be this relationship between phonological probability and aversion,"" he said. ""In other words, something that is improbable, something that doesn't sound like it should belong in your language, has this emotional reaction that goes along with it.""

Dr. Eagleman said that his lab's experiments were a prelude to neuroimaging that could investigate how the brain responds when faced with aversive words. But in the meantime, it might help to compile a broader list of words that certain people cannot stand.

So here's a question for you: Forgetting all things moist for a second, what other words (without explicit sexual, scatological, racial or taboo connotations) do you find repulsive? And we don't mean the merely annoying (like ""literally"") or obnoxious (like ""synergy""), but words that are viscerally repellent.

Name them, and tell us why they disgust you in the comments section. Feel free to recommend words already listed by others.",high,test

A skin-crawling video shows the hilarious moment a couple find a huge spider hidden in their bunch of bananas.

But while the woman remains relatively calm - it is her husband who is frightened for his life.

In the clip, a white egg sac appears to be resting on top of one of the banana skins.

The couple poke gingerly at the object with the sharp end of a knife before it starts to split open.

Inside, the huge eight-legged creature can be seen curled up inside the bag.

108,"Cycling in cities with heavy air pollution still good for health: study

The health benefits of walking and cycling outweigh the harm on health from air pollution, even in cities with high levels of air pollution, according to a study published online Thursday in the journal Preventive Medicine.

Air pollution is one of the leading environmental risk factors for people's health. One of the main sources of air pollution in cities is transport and a shift from cars, motorbikes and buses to active travel, such as walking and cycling, would help to reduce emissions. However, people who walk or cycle in such environments will inhale more pollution, which could be detrimental to their health.

Previous studies conducted in Europe, the United States and several other developed countries found that the health benefits of active travel are greater than the risks, but these were undertaken in areas of relatively low air pollution, and the applicability of their results to more polluted cities in emerging economies has been uncertain.

The new study led by researchers from the University of Cambridge used computer simulations to compare the risks and benefits for different levels of intensity and duration of active travel and of air pollution in different locations around the world, using information from international epidemiological studies and meta-analyses.

Using the data, the researchers calculated that in practical terms, air pollution risks will not negate the health benefits of active travel in the vast majority of urban areas worldwide.

Only one percent of cities in the World Health Organization's Ambient Air Pollution Database had pollution levels high enough that the risks of air pollution could start to overcome the benefits of physical activity after half an hour of cycling every day, according to the study.

""Even in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world -- with pollution levels ten times those in London -- people would need to cycle over five hours per week before the pollution risks outweigh the health benefits,"" said Dr Marko Tainio from the University of Cambridge, who led the study.

But a small minority of workers in the most polluted cities, such as bike messengers, may be exposed to levels of air pollution high enough to cancel out the health benefits of physical activity, said Tainio.

This research provides further support for investment in infrastructure to get people out of their cars and onto their feet or their bikes, which can itself reduce pollution levels at the same time as supporting physical activity, according to the researchers.",high,test
109,"Researchers say they're closing in on the mystery of Captain Cook's ship

Researchers say they believe the ship that 18th-century explorer Capt. James Cook used to sail around the world is still submerged in Rhode Island's Newport Harbor, but it will take a lot of work and money to identify it.

The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, which is leading the search effort, said at a news conference in Providence last week that it has narrowed its search to a group of five sunken wrecks.

Nearly 250 years ago, Cook ran aground on Australia's Great Barrier Reef during a voyage to the South Pacific. His ship was the Endeavour, an awkward little vessel that improbably helped him become the first European to chart Australia's east coast. He used the Endeavour to claim Australia for the British during his historic 1768-1771 voyage.

""The Endeavour is considered to be the founding vessel for Australia,"" said Kathy Abbass, founder and executive director of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project.

The Endeavour was also part of a fleet of 13 ships the British scuttled during the Revolutionary War in 1778 to blockade Newport Harbor from the French, Abbass said. It was listed in the records under a different name, the Lord Sandwich.

Abbass's group recently located documents in London identifying the groups of ships in that fleet and where each was scuttled. The nonprofit thinks the Endeavour is part of a group of five sunken wrecks. ""We know there were five. We know we mapped four. We think we can find the fifth one,"" Abbass said. ""That's for this year, to find the fifth one.""

Remote sensing data appear to show the fifth site, but it could be badly disturbed, Abbass said. She said she won't know for sure until divers investigate. Even if all five sites are located, Abbass said, she may not find enough conclusive evidence to say that one of them is the Endeavour. If the Endeavour is found, it will belong to Rhode Island, Abbass said.",high,test

The EU has ruled that all cigarette packaging should be made of a combination of human faeces, stinging nettles and misery in an effort to discourage smokers.

""There is considerable evidence that handling a combination of faeces, nettles and misery will prove off-putting to most people,"" said health campaigner Simon Williams.

""Particularly amongst the young who consider having all stung fingers that smell of excrement to be really quite ""uncool.""""

Targeting the packaging of cigarettes is a popular tactic around the world.

111,"Death Sentences in India Usually End in Question Marks, Study Finds

India aggressively imposes death sentences but hardly ever executes anyone.

A new study conducted by the National Law University, which is led by high-ranking judges and lawyers, found that 1,810 death sentences were issued between 2000 and 2014, but only four people have been executed.

Among the prisoners interviewed for the study, the median wait for a ruling on their appeal was six and a half years, with one prisoner waiting more than two decades to learn his fate.

The study, which was made public on Friday, is the first major effort in India to interview a large group of death-row prisoners and evaluate their treatment. The authorities in India's prison and court systems did not review the report and have not offered any reaction.

More than 95 percent of death sentences imposed since 2000 were overturned or commuted by higher courts, the study found. But the prolonged uncertainty prisoners faced had a profound psychological effect on them.

Isolation had an effect ""amounting to torture""

Some prisoners were ""extremely hopeful,"" according to the report, and others said that they ""would rather be executed than live a life with the possibility of an execution looming large.""

Among those interviewed for the report was a man identified as Jayakanthan -- like other subjects, he is identified by a pseudonym for his protection. He ""blinked continuously for the first few minutes,"" the report's authors wrote, because he was kept in a cell with no source of sunlight for all but 20 minutes a day. His only human contact was with the guard outside his cell, the report said, and he told researchers that his primary interaction was with lizards that he had lured by sharing his food.

""He felt that the noises made by the lizards were to thank him for feeding them,"" the report said. He also told the researchers that the lizards kept visiting his cell, not for food but to ""make noises as though talking to him as their friend.""

Other prisoners reported that they were tormented by mosquitoes during their long incarceration, or that they were kept awake by a light bulb in their cell that burned through the night.

'Nobody tells them anything' about the progress of their appeals

The study described ""a complete lack of engagement"" between defense lawyers and their clients on death row, and it suggests that lawyers were not inclined to do more because of the ""extremely low fees"" that defendants' families were able to pay.

Among 258 prisoners interviewed about their legal representation, nearly 77 percent said that they had never met their lawyers out of court, and that their interactions in court were ""perfunctory."" More than 70 percent complained that their lawyers did not discuss case details with them, mostly talking about how they would get paid.

Prisoners complained that legal aid lawyers, at the trial court and appellate court levels, tried to extort money from the families of death-row prisoners, threatening not to turn up for hearings unless they were paid. With a few exceptions, death row prisoners ""remained ignorant of the whole process, and also of their fate, whether they will live or die,"" said Anup Surendranath, the report's lead author. ""They become the most irrelevant person in the whole process.""

Uncertainty itself becomes the source of psychological strain

With no access to information about their appeals, prisoners interviewed for the report said they ""spend their time constantly wondering if the end has come, every time the huge iron doors of the barracks are pushed open.""

One prisoner, whose appeal was rejected after a six-and-a-half-year wait, said he had only learned that his execution would proceed when he saw it announced on the television news he was watching in prison. He became so agitated that he tried to kill himself with a piece of floor tile before the state could execute him. The day before he was to be hanged, he learned that the Supreme Court had stayed his execution.

A prisoner convicted of murdering his five daughters described a meal of lentils, flat bread and vegetables, which he was told would be his last. He had mixed feelings upon learning he would be hanged: He feared death, he said, but he was also grateful that the uncertainty of death row would come to an end.

The day he was to be executed, the Supreme Court issued a stay order, in a painful twist, on the grounds that he had never received official notice that his petition for mercy had been rejected.",high,test

Drake has scored a number one double bill - topping both the UK single and album chart.

His latest album, Views, has knocked Beyonce's Lemonade off the top, pushing it into second place.

Billy Ocean and Travis both have new entries in the top five.

Drake's One Dance remained top of the singles chart, while Calvin Harris and Rihanna's track This is What You Came For was a new entry at number two.

There were no other new entries in the whole of the top 40 singles chart.

Canadian rapper Drake's album is the second fastest seller of the year so far, according to the Official Charts Company, notching up sales of 78,000 and putting it just behind David Bowie's Blackstar for quick sales.

It is his fourth studio album - and fourth chart-topper.

Prince still has four albums in the top 40, with The Very Best Of... the highest placed, at number three.

Billy Ocean's return to the chart is a combination of a new album, Here You Are, and a bonus Best Off... featuring the likes of Caribbean Queen and When the Going Gets Tough.

Scottish band Travis have now released eight studio albums, with their latest, Everything at Once, landing in the chart at number five.

Other new album chart entries include Tremonti (16), Rob Zombie (25) and Brian Eno (28).",high,test
116,"Eta member jailed for 92 years for plot to kill Spanish king

Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui planned to throw grenades at Juan Carlos during Guggenheim Museum opening in 1997

A Spanish court sentenced a member of the Basque separatist group Eta to 92 years in prison over a failed plot to kill Spain's king at the opening of Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum in 1997.

Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui and another Eta member had planned to lob grenades at Juan Carlos during the inauguration in northern Spain, according to the national court.

But police stumbled upon the plot as the two men, dressed as gardeners, were attempting to hide the weapons in flowerpots outside the museum five days before its scheduled opening on 18 October.

Gogeaskoetxea shot dead a police officer at close range in an ensuing firefight and managed to escape, the court added.

Gogeaskoetxea, 49, was arrested in the Cambridge, England, in July 2011 - where he had been living for several years under a false identity - after a fellow Spaniard recognised him at a squash club.

He was sentenced to 30 years in jail for murdering a police officer and another 15 years for conspiring against the monarchy. He was handed down a further 47 years behind bars for several other crimes related to the plot, including forgery of public documents and possessing weapons.

Under Spanish law, a convicted criminal can serve a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, unless he is convicted of carrying out deadly terrorist attacks in which case a life sentence is possible.

Gogeaskoetxea's lawyers had fought against his extradition to Spain, arguing that he faced a real risk of ""a flagrant denial of justice"" in the country because the accusations against him were based on the confessions of a co-defendant who was allegedly denied proper access to a lawyer.

Britain's high court rejected the appeal in 2012 and he was extradited.

Eta has been blamed for more than 800 killings in its campaign of bombings and shootings to create an independent Basque territory in north Spain and south-west France. The group's last deadly attack in Spain was in August 2009.

In October 2011, it declared a ""definitive end to armed activity"" but it has yet to formally disband or disarm as the Spanish and French governments demand.

Eta has been linked to several other assassination plots on Juan Carlos, 78, who abdicated the throne to his son Felipe in 2014.",high,test
117,"British researchers reveal engine for future nano-machines

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have revealed recently in a new study that they have built the world's smallest engine.

The tiny engine, just a few billionths of a meter in size, uses light to power itself and could form the basis of future nano-machines that can navigate in water, sense the environment around them, or even enter living cells to fight disease.

The prototype device is made of tiny charged particles of gold, bound together with temperature-responsive polymers in the form of a gel.

When the tiny engine is heated to a certain temperature with a laser, it stores large amounts of elastic energy in a fraction of a second, as the polymer coatings expel all the water from the gel and collapse.

This has the effect of forcing the gold nanoparticles to bind together into tight clusters. When the device is cooled, the polymers take on water and expand, and the gold nanoparticles are strongly and quickly pushed apart, like a spring.

""We know that light can heat up water to power steam engines,"" said Dr. Ventsislav Valev, co-author of the study published in the journal PNAS earlier on Monday and now based at the University of Bath. ""Now we can use light to power a piston engine at the nanoscale.""

Professor Jeremy Baumberg from the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, who led the research, has named the devices 'ANTs', or actuating nano-transducers.

""Like real ants, they produce large forces for their weight. The challenge we now face is how to control that force for nano-machinery applications,"" he said in a statement.",high,test

China's college students increasingly use wealth management services, but still need to learn that risk and return are proportionate, a survey by Tsinghua University and Ant Financial shows.

Over one third of Chinese college students expect their investments to generate an annual return over 10 percent, and over 60 percent believe that there are investment options with high returns and very little risk, according to the report, which polled 5,000 Chinese college students born in the 1990s.

Such high expectations and lack of risk awareness, the report said, could make college students vulnerable to questionable products that downplay the risks that usually justify high returns.

The report found that students appeared more interested in opportunistic gain than in prudent investment decisions. Over 40 percent said they invested in stocks, the top option, despite the high volatility of China's stock market.

The report advised that investment knowledge be incorporated into the national curriculum to help the new generation put wealth management into perspective.

119,"Expert helped Los Angeles police hack Apple iPhone: court records

A cellphone expert overrode the lock function on an Apple iPhone to help Los Angeles police in a homicide investigation around the time U.S. authorities were battling the company to open other phones in criminal cases, court records showed on Thursday.

The successful hack of the iPhone 5s in the Los Angeles case is another sign U.S. authorities are turning to third-party contractors to unlock smartphones rather than relying on manufacturers like Apple Inc, which helped in the past. The third-party hacks have Apple racing to strengthen its encryption technology.

Los Angeles police gained access to the iPhone of April Jace, the wife of ""The Shield"" actor Michael Jace, who is accused of shooting her to death, at their home in May 2014.

Police investigators learned on March 18 that a forensic cellphone expert, whose identity was not released, could ""override the locked iPhone function"" on April Jace's phone to extract data, Detective Connie Zych wrote in a search warrant affidavit.

That was around the time the U.S. government was locked in a legal battle with Apple over requests the company unlock the iPhone 5c used by Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the San Bernardino killings.

Apple refused to bypass the encryption features on Farook's phone on grounds it could undermine security for all users. The company declined to comment on the Jace case.

The override of April Jace's iPhone 5s was less of a technical feat than the unlocking of Farook's iPhone 5c.

Jace's phone predated the iOS 8 operating system, which Apple introduced in fall 2014 with strengthened encryption methods. The contractor who unlocked Farook's iPhone 5c had to get past iOS 9, an operating system released in September 2015.

Apple helped authorities gain access to iPhones about 70 times before changing its position last year, court documents have shown.

It was unclear which OS was installed on Jace's iPhone. Her killing came after Apple released iOS 7, but before iOS 8.

In another high-profile case, the U.S. Department of Justice fought Apple in court seeking to force the company to assist authorities in accessing an iPhone 5S with iOS7 seized as evidence in a New York drug case.

Last month, the Department of Justice dropped the effort when it disclosed someone provided authorities the passcode to the device.

The hack of April Jace's iPhone appears to be related to an order in January by the judge to allow Michael Jace's defense team access to the phone.

Michael Jace's attorney in January argued in court the actor suspected his wife was having an affair and may have become enraged moments before the shooting, after seeing something on her iPhone, according to a report at the time from the New York Daily News.",high,test

121,"Digging for growth in China? Not quite yet, say excavator makers

The makers of China's excavators and bulldozers should be rejoicing: after two years of consecutive monthly declines, overall sales were up in the first three months of the year, while property sales and construction activity revived.

Not so, say dealers, consultants to the industry and construction equipment manufacturers themselves: a stronger start to 2016 is less the start of a tepid recovery than a temporary blip. It is only masking continued pain for a sector that flourished during the construction frenzy that propelled China past the global financial crisis.

New emissions rules drove sales, but factories that once churned out excavators and loaders are still working only at a fraction of capacity - as little as 20 to 25 percent, they said.

Choking off new sales, machines bought at the peak are still barely used, while fleets of equipment seized from bankrupt contractors are clogging the second-hand market.

Rosier economic indicators earlier this year - including a pickup in construction - prompted more than a few economists to revise higher their predictions for China's 2016 growth. April data, though, is less robust, raising concerns that any resurgence may be fizzling out.

A Reuters reporter's visit to dealerships on Beijing's outskirts found a half-empty dealer compound and deserted forecourts, where new excavators and forklift trucks still in their packaging were lined up alongside battered used models. There was no sign of buyers.

Speaking at a dealership in Beijing's northeastern suburbs that sells Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co's equipment, manager Dang Yongli said that at the peak, he could barely keep up with demand for new machines.

""Many customers just couldn't wait. They would go to LiuGong directly, and line up outside the workshop,"" he said. Now, two out of every three machines he sells are used.

The slack in the system means even the world's largest heavy equipment maker, Caterpillar Inc, cautiously optimistic and more positive than some, urged caution last month.

Back outside Beijing, Han, a salesman for domestic brand Lonking Holdings said January to April saw growth in large part because of new emissions rules that had customers pulling forward purchases to get cheaper deals. He said the demand won't hold.

122,"Oil drillers dig for the bottom for rig counts

For the past year and a half, a chart of the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation has resembled a death-defying ski slope - but soon it may be time to get back on the chair lift.

The U.S. rig count may finally be bottoming out as U.S. oil companies look for oil prices to rally just a bit more, a signal that the time has come to deploy more capital and get production moving again, analysts say.

The number of active oil rigs in the United States has fallen for seven consecutive weeks, as of data released Friday. Some believe the rig count will start to rise, as drillers plan to ramp up production if benchmark U.S. crude reaches the trigger level of $50 a barrel. U.S. crude prices hit a year-to-date high of $46.78 last week.

In the past two weeks, oil producers including Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Pioneer Natural Resources have cited an improving outlook for oil prices, executives said on calls discussing earnings. Dave Lesar, chief executive of oilfield services provider Halliburton Co, said he believes the rig count has hit a bottom and likely will rise this year.

The U.S. rig count generally reacts to prices with a three or four-month lag, so following the nadir for crude in February, it should bottom in the next month, Morgan Stanley's head of energy commodity research Adam Longson said in a report this week.

""The same analysis also suggests a notable increase in rig activity may be ahead - potentially reversing much of the decline over the past several months,"" he wrote.

Some companies are already resuming drilling on wells that had been put on hold, known as drilled-uncompleted projects, and planning to drill new wells.

""Our estimates are that at $45-$50 WTI some of the light tight oil goes into production,"" said Mark Routt, Chief economist in the Americas for KBC Advanced Technologies, referring to a technical name for the type of oil in shale formations. ""When you have the front of the market lift, as it has done, it makes it that much easier to justify coming back on.""

U.S. crude prices, after hitting their year-to-date high on April 29, have gained support from output disruptions in Canada during the past week, indicating that the market is becoming more responsive to fundamental supply concerns that have often failed to elicit a price response during the rout.

Companies are expected to be cautious as they redeploy rigs, so the count will not rapidly accelerate and blunt the impact of the increase in crude prices.

The current count of 332 rigs is unlikely to surge back to the 668 seen a year ago, to say nothing of 2014's peak north of 1,600 rigs.

Exploration and production companies have planned for capital expenditures at about half of last-year's levels. If companies stay consistent with this guidance, the rig count should remain fairly flat, said Bob Brackett, a senior research analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York.

Brackett cited an analysis of drilling data from Texas showing a six-month lag between the time when rigs are deployed and when the well pad hits peak production. So even as rig counts increase slightly, ""we still see a six-month lag with supply response,"" Brackett said.

Companies also are likely to be highly selective in which rigs they deploy as they increase drilling operations, said Fadel Gheit, senior energy strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. Companies are likely to only drill top wells as they will be wary that prices could decline again, he said.

""It's easier to cut than to redeploy,"" said Gheit. ""The companies have very little wiggle room, there is no room for error. You miss you're dead.""",high,test
123,"UN highlights role of midwives in achieving development targets

The United Nations on Thursday highlighted the role of midwives in achieving development targets as some 300,000 women still die every year during pregnancy and childbirth and almost 3 million babies do not survive their first four weeks of life.

Yet a majority of these deaths could be averted by trained midwives, the world organization said as it marked the International Day of the Midwife with a call for strengthened skills and investments in midwifery.

""Midwives are our heroes and the backbone of sexual and reproductive health. Let us support them and the women and newborns at the heart of their care,"" said Babatunde Osotimehin, the executive director of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA).

Saluting the contribution of midwives to saving the lives of women, adolescent girls and newborns, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, Osotimehin said that midwives are essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

SDGs were approved by world leaders in September last year to serve as the blueprint for the global development efforts for the next 15 years.

""Well-trained and supported midwives working in communities are uniquely positioned to provide the compassionate, respectful and culturally sensitive care a woman needs during pregnancy and childbirth,"" he said.

""Midwifery is equally important for newborns during the critical first month of life, and is a significant contribution to sexual and reproductive health in general,"" the executive director said.

The International Day of the Midwife is observed annually around the world on May 5. This year's theme is Women and Newborns: The Heart of Midwifery.

The UNFPA chief noted that while in the past 25 years, the world has almost halved maternal deaths, the vast majority of these largely preventable deaths take place in developing and crisis-affected countries.

""If deployed in larger numbers, trained midwives could avert approximately two thirds of these deaths. Significant investments in midwifery are essential if the world is to achieve its ambitious goals of reducing maternal and newborn deaths,"" Osotimehin said.

For its part, UNFPA is helping to train and support thousands of midwives in more than 100 countries.

Meanwhile, the executive director also highlighted a recent survey estimating that in 57 of these countries, the agency has trained 66,000 midwives over the past seven years.

""These critical health-care providers can help more than 11 million women give birth safely each year, but much more needs to be done,"" he said.

""On this International Day of the Midwife, we at UNFPA renew our commitment to working with global partners and countries to strengthen midwifery skills and capacities,"" he said.

""We call on countries to acclaim and reward midwives who are working in challenging and hard-to-reach areas, where their services are most needed,"" he added. ""We also urge countries to invest in quality training, good working conditions, decent salaries, adequate workforce policies and possibilities for professional growth.""",high,test

125,"FCC confirms approval of Charter, Time Warner Cable merger

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission confirmed on Friday that it had voted to approve Charter Communications Inc's acquisitions of Time Warner Cable Inc and Bright House Networks.

The deals, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider, now need approval from regulators in California.

A state administrative judge last month recommended that California's public utilities commission approve the deal. The decision is expected at a May 12 hearing.

Tom Rutledge, president and chief executive of Charter, said in a statement Friday that the transactions have ""significant benefits"" including greater competition, broader access to affordable broadband, and new U.S. jobs. The FCC-imposed conditions ""are largely extensions of the longstanding consumer friendly values and practices of our company,"" Rutledge said.

A majority of the five-member FCC voted to approve the deals earlier this week.

The FCC said in a statement Friday that an ""order detailing the commission's reasoning and the conditions will be issued in the coming days.""

Charter has valued its deal for Time Warner Cable at $56.7 billion, excluding debt, and the acquisition of Bright House at $10.4 billion.

The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25 and earlier Charter and Time Warner Cable shareholders approved the companies' deal.

The Justice Department's approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix Inc and Hulu.

The Justice Department said Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online as part of the approval process.

The conditions placed on FCC approval would require Charter to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said.

Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, had pursued Time Warner Cable as far back as 2013.

The two companies had acrimonious exchanges in 2013 and early 2014 that ended with Time Warner Cable rejecting unsolicited approaches by Charter and instead finding a white knight in Comcast Corp, the No. 1 U.S. cable services provider, which ultimately abandoned the transaction.

Separately, the FCC on Tuesday approved European telecoms group Altice NV's acquisition of U.S. cable company Cablevision Systems Corp in a $17.7 billion deal that includes assumption of debt.

The Dutch firm still needs approval from the state of New York and New York City. If the deal is approved, Altice would become the fourth largest U.S. cable provider. Cablevision has 3.1 million subscribers, mostly in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.",high,test

In Friday's vote, Kenny secured 59 votes in favor and 49 votes against. He got the support of his party of 50 and 9 independent TDs (members of parliament), which guarantees him forming a minority government with independent TDs.

Kenny is first Fine Gael leader to be reelected Taoiseach, while the 59-49 vote was the lowest level of support in the country's history.

All 43 TDs from Fianna Fail (Republican Party), Fine Gael's main rival, abstained in the vote.

During his acceptance speech, Kenny pledged to work together in the best interest of all Irish people.

He said he will oversee the implementation of the program for the government and oversee political reforms, adding his country faces many challenges.

Kenny said that while the government got Ireland back from the edge of an economic cliff, he recognized that not everyone has experienced the recovery.

After the vote, Kenny went to Aras an Uachtarain (presidential office) to receive his seal of office from Irish President Michael D Higgins.

He will then return to Leinster House, the seat of the Irish parliament, and formally select his cabinet minister before leading them into the Dail Eireann later on Friday. The new ministers will take over their departments on Monday.

Last week, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail agreed on a minority government deal after weeks of talks.

During final talks, Fianna Fail agreed to support the Fine Gael-led minority government over three budgets and there is a broad agreement on a range of fronts, including rent supplement increases and water charges.

A minority government would mean that Fine Gael or Fianna Fail would need to secure support from other parties on an issue-by-issue basis in order to get legislation through.

127,"""Starving"" cancer cells a key to new tumor treatments: Aussie researchers

Australian researches believe ""starving"" cancer cells could be the key to prevent the growth of tumors, paving the way for the development of new cancer-beating drugs.

Scientists at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra announced the breakthrough on Friday, in which they found and blocked a vital ""supply route"" that cancer cells use to obtain nutrients and grow.

Professor Stefan Broer from the ANU Research School of Biology said his team identified the ""gateways"" through which cancer cells ""feed"", blocked them and then found the cells almost completely stopped growing, in a discovery which could revolutionize chemotherapy and save lives.

""This should lead to chemotherapy with much less serious side-effects, as normal cells do not use glutamine as a building material,"" Broer said in a statement released on Friday.

""Crucial white blood cells, which current treatments damage, could be spared, and it could cut out the hair loss that chemotherapy causes.""

He said that most cancer research undertaken currently is focused on one particular strain of cancer cell, whereas his team's discovery could be used to stop the growth of hundreds of different cancer types.

""This is likely to work in a wide range of cancers, because it is a very common mechanism in cancer cells,"" Broer said.

He added that his team initially identified one ""gateway"" which it blocked by disabling the cells' ""glutamine transport mechanism,"" but the cancer found another way to feed on nutrients. The team then found and blocked a second gateway and the cancer cells stopped growing.

Lead author Angelika Broer, also from ANU Research School of Biology, said cancer research was improving in leaps and bounds as technology gets better, with the ANU team to use robots to test ""thousands"" of potential cancer stopping drugs for their ability to successfully block the gateways.

""It is an exciting time to do cancer research. We now have precision tools in our hands to manipulate the genome of cancer cells, allowing us to address problems that were difficult to solve previously,"" Broer said.

""We have developed a set of tests which make it very easy to determine if a drug is targeting glutamine transporters.""

Syrian government forces fired tear gas and live ammunition into Hama prison on Friday as they tried to put down a revolt by its inmates, a monitoring group said, and an opposition source said some prisoners had choked from the fumes.

The prison has been surrounded by government forces since hundreds of prisoners rioted and seized several guards on Monday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Friday's fighting was the second attempt to storm the prison in the western part of the country, the Britain-based group reported.

A Syrian opposition official in contact with prisoners said security forces had fired an unidentified gas into the facility, causing 25 cases of suffocation but no deaths.

The official said Syria's main opposition body, the High Negotiations Committee, had informed the United States and the U.N.'s Syria envoy about the situation. The HNC earlier said it held the international community responsible for a ""massacre"" of inmates it expected government forces to carry out.

The Syrian interior ministry has denied ""reports ... about Hama central prison"", but has not elaborated on the issue since Monday.

Syrian insurgent groups, including the powerful Islamist Ahrar al-Sham, threatened to shell all the bases of government forces in Hama province if Damascus did not meet the demands of the inmates.

The prisoners rioted to protest the attempted transfer of some of them to Sednaya military prison, north of Damascus, and because trials had been postponed, the Observatory said. The HNC said they wanted better conditions in jail.

Earlier on Friday, the Observatory said, negotiations had led to the release of dozens of prisoners.

Those held in the jail include political and Islamist prisoners. International rights groups say thousands of detainees are held in Syrian government prisons without charge and many of them are subjected to torture, a claim denied by the authorities.

Phil Foss raised more than $1,300 in one day for his shipping-container pen holder on Kickstarter.

Who: Phil Foss, 37, a web developer at Higher Logic, an Arlington-based software firm. Foss is also the founder of Tyo Toys, a line of products inspired by street art and graffiti.

What: A desktop pen-holder that looks like a shipping container.

Where: Fairfax, Va.

Raised: $1,369 (as of May 5) of a $300 goal. The campaign began May 4 and goes through June 3.

What's the pitch?

Phil Foss is what you might call a connoisseur of corrugated plastic.

Ever since he stumbled upon the ribbed material two years ago, he's been looking for way to incorporate it into new products.

His latest creation: A pen-holder that looks like a shipping container.

""I was looking for something that was very simple to produce, and this is what I came up with,"" Foss said. ""The shape itself is simple -- it's just an open-top rectangle -- and the ridges are good for hanging pens.""

He fashioned a quick prototype using a sheet of plastic and four bolts, and posted it on Instagram to show his 4,700 followers.

Immediately, someone from California placed an order. He bought 250 of the containers, emblazoned with a company logo for Built Rite Industries.

""I wasn't expecting that,"" he said. ""It looked cool so I thought people would want it, but it happened very fast.""

After that, he decided to try his hand at Kickstarter. Earlier this year, Foss used the crowdfunding site to raise $1,561 for a Hot Wheels driftpad -- a corrugated plastic surface that allows toy cars to ""drift"" or have their tail end swing out as they corner.

""That turned out really well,"" he said, adding that he has sold more than 300 driftpads to date. ""So I thought, maybe I'd do it again.""

How did you come up your $300 goal for the pen holder?

""I set a low bar,"" Foss said. ""I think people enjoy over-funding something simple.""

Foss said he knew he didn't need too much money to get started.

He already had a U.S. manufacturer lined up, and the actual containers don't cost much either: A single prototype is about $60, but if he orders 50, he gets them for $5 a piece.

He decided to set a goal of $300 to cover his first 50 products, as well as shipping costs. A $14 pledge on Kickstarter will get donors one blue shipping container; for $24 they get two, one blue and one orange.

""There are decent margins as long as I have the quantity,"" Foss said.

But, he added, ""selling plastic doesn't pay the bills.""

For that, he has his day job as a web designer. Foss has a degree in graphic design from James Madison University and in his spare time runs Tyo Toys, a line of products inspired by street art and graffiti.

How quickly did you meet your goal?

Wednesday morning, before he'd even gotten his coffee, Foss sat down at his work computer and set up his Kickstarter campaign.

It went live at 10:51. Then he waited.

""It was a couple of hours of nothing,"" he said. ""I was getting worried. I thought, 'What if people don't think this is that cool?,' "" he said.

But he needn't have worried, Within a few hours, the donations began pouring in. He met his goal in six hours. Within 24 hours, he'd raised $1,340 -- more than four times what he was seeking.

""I knew it looked cool, so I can't say I'm totally surprised,"" Foss said. ""I knew people would buy it.""",high,test

Speculation rife about piracy or fire on board Tamaya 1, registered in Panama, who last known position was on 21 April near Gambia and Senegal

An abandoned oil tanker has washed up on the shores of Liberia in west Africa, prompting an investigation - and speculation over the fate of the ship's crew.

The Tamaya 1, which is registered in Panama, ran aground on a beach near Robertsport earlier this week, apparently without a crew or lifeboats. On Thursday the Liberia national police and bureau of immigration inspected the ship, days after local residents first discovered it on the beach.

The 64-meter (210ft) tanker's last known position was on 21 April near Gambia and Senegal, according to shipping site Marine Traffic - well north of Liberia along the west African coast. The ship was en route to the Senegalese port of Dakar, according to the site.

The Liberia national police and the Liberia maritime authority did not immediately respond to a call for comment.

""Our best bet is that the vessel's owner might have gone broke and had no money to pay crew members,"" a source at the nation's port authority told the Liberian Daily Observer. ""And therefore, the crew abandoned the ship.""

Asked about why maritime authorities had responded so slowly to the mystery of a crewless oil tanker, the source said: ""Robertsport does not have a seaport.""

After several days beached on the shoreline, the ship was reportedly looted and vandalized and speculation was rife that pirates or a fire had caused the crew to abandon the ship. Since investigation began, police have tried to keep civilians away from the ship.

Witnesses did not testify for either side during the hearing, but lawyers on both sides of the case discussed with Gregor the evidence they were presenting and provided a new window into how Lin became the target of a sting operation. It is not clear what information Lin is accused of sharing, but Stephens said that U.S. Pacific Command and the secretive Joint Special Operations Command have reviewed information in the case.

Lin has been held in pretrial confinement for nine months. He is accused of two counts of espionage, three counts of attempted espionage, communicating secret information ""with intent or reason to believe it would be used to the advantage of a foreign nation,"" hiring a prostitute for sex, committing adultery by having sex with a woman who is not his wife, and falsifying federal records about where he traveled abroad, according to a heavily redacted charging document released by the Navy.

U.S. officials have said authorities are investigating whether Lin planned to provide information to his home country of Taiwan, China, or both. He and his family left Taiwan when he 14, and he enlisted in the Navy in late 1999 and was commissioned as a naval flight officer in May 2002, specializing in operating airborne weapons and sensors. He became a citizen in 2008, and at the time of his arrest was assigned to Special Projects Patrol Squadron 2, a secretive aviation unit based in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, that flies P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft in the Pacific.

A civilian lawyer representing Lin, Larry Younger, told the hearing officer that the government engaged in a ""nefarious scheme to entrap"" his client and ""preyed on his vulnerabilities."" He was vague in his defense, but said ""there's nothing heinous"" in what Lin was doing.

""How many times does he ever say: 'I was trying to aid Taiwan. I was trying to hurt the United States.'?"" Younger asked rhetorically, implying that the answer was none.

Stephens, the prosecutor, alleged that Lin confessed to many of the charges he now faces. Younger disagreed, saying Lin was not clear about what was happening following an ""initial ambush apprehension"" in the Honolulu airport that violated his legal rights.

The charges that Lin faces come in part from a search of his email dating back to 2012, Younger said. He protested the evidence that emerged, saying it was enabled by the sting operation.

An FBI spokesman declined to comment on the case or Younger's accusations Thursday, citing the case's open nature.",high,test

133,"Arsenio Hall to sue O'Connor over Prince comments

Comedian Arsenio Hall is suing Sinead O'Connor after she suggested he supplied drugs to Prince.

O'Connor alleged on Facebook that Hall had been providing drugs to the singer, who died last month, for ""decades"".

Hall filed a $5m libel suit against O'Connor on Thursday, for damages to his reputation.

The comedian said O'Connor's accusations were ""despicable, fabricated lies"" and labelled her a ""desperate attention-seeker.""

O'Connor claimed she had reported Hall to the sheriff's department in the Minneapolis suburbs that is investigating Prince's sudden death.

In one of two Facebook posts about Hall, the Irish singer advised the comedian to ""expect their call"".

""They are aware you spiked me years ago at Eddie Murphy's house. You best get tidying your man cave,"" she wrote.

Hall is best known as the former presenter of a popular late-night talk show in the US and as Murphy's co-star in the film Coming to America.

A lawsuit by his lawyers filed in a Los Angeles court stated: ""O'Connor is now known perhaps as much for her bizarre, unhinged rants as for her music.""

It added the accusations would have been read by ""countless people"" on Facebook and through subsequent news reports.

He has asked for a jury trial for libel, estimating the damages to his reputation to be ""not less than"" $5m.

The complaint says the full extent of the damages is ""not presently known"", and therefore the amount could be amended before or at trial ""if deemed necessary by the court"".

In the lawsuit, Hall said he has had little contact with O'Connor and questioned her knowledge of Prince's life, noting that she previously admitted a tense relationship with him.

134,"How climate change may be fueling Canada's fire season

A devastating wildfire continues to rage around Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada, having grown to more than ten times its original size and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Now, as firefighters struggle to contain the flames, some experts are saying that the blaze was likely helped along by factors related to climate change -- which may also be contributing to a bigger trend in lengthier, more intense Northern fire seasons.

Around the same time the Fort McMurray fire sprang up (it arose Sunday from unknown causes), researchers from the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab released some alarming findings. According to satellite data, last month saw the lowest area of snow cover in the northern hemisphere of any April in the past 50 years, at just over 27.9 million square kilometers of coverage. The previous record-holder was April of 1968, with 28 million square kilometers.

While all the factors that played into the low snow extent remain to be explored, the findings generally suggest that this year's mild winter caused snow to melt faster and earlier than in previous years, said David Robinson, the New Jersey state climatologist, who helps run the Rutgers Global Snow Lab. And some scientists, including Robinson, have suggested that the low snow extent could make for a dryer, more severe fire season in the north.

The intensity of a wildfire season depends on several key factors, according to Mike Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. The three basic ingredients for a fire are fuel, in the form of trees or brush; an ignition source, usually lightning or humans; and hot, windy weather.

""What's really important is fuel moisture -- so how dry the fuels are determines whether the fire will start, whether it's from human causes or lightning,"" Flannigan said. ""If the fuels are wet, the fire won't start.""

Typically, a heavy snow cover in the winter means that melting in the spring will add moisture to both the soil and the organic fuels that feed fires when the weather warms. Thus, the two snow-related factors that may affect a fire season are how early the snow melts and how much water it releases when it does so.

Robinson has suggested that earlier melting, like what we've seen in the northern hemisphere this spring, can give forests and grasslands a chance to dry out earlier and provide the potential for a longer fire season. It's a point other experts have raised as well.

""The earlier the snow melts, the longer the fire season -- so the more days during which fires can ignite and burn,"" said David Martell, a forestry professor and fire expert at the University of Toronto, by email, although he noted that he's unaware of any studies that have explicitly investigated this connection.

However, Flannigan feels that the timing of snowmelt may not be as important as the total amount of moisture it releases. In any case, he noted that this past winter was unusually dry for Canada, setting the stage for a rough start to fire season -- and Robinson also noted that April's record-low snow cover could have been partly caused by the fact that ""there was less of it to melt.""

Regardless, earlier melting and shallower snowpack to begin with were likely brought on by a combination of several factors, including the lingering effects of last year's unusually severe El Nino event and the influence of climate change.

""El Nino in this part of the world [means] mild winters, dry winters, typically followed by mild springs and dry springs -- and that's exactly what's happened,"" Flannigan said. Alberta, in particular, did experience a dry winter with unusually low levels of precipitation and was in the throes of an especially warm April when the Fort McMurray fire struck.

From a broader perspective, though, Robinson pointed out that the low snow extent observed in April is part of a longer trend that's likely related to the ongoing march of climate change. Three out of the five lowest April snow extents have occurred in the past 10 years -- and overall, low snow cover in the spring has occurred more and more frequently in the past several decades.

The pattern is most pronounced in May and June, Robinson said, noting that April's low record almost certainly indicates that we'll be seeing unusually low snow cover during the next few months, as well. And he added that ""snow extent of the last decade is declining at a rate in the spring that's more pronounced than the rate that [Arctic] sea ice is declining in the summer.""

It's possible that declines in snow cover may even be contributing to climate change through a kind of feedback effect, he pointed out. Snow helps to reflect sunlight away from the Earth and back out into space -- so less snow cover means more solar radiation is being absorbed, which leads to greater warming of the Earth's surface. This, in turn, causes more snow to melt.

Still, snow is just one of many weather- and climate-related factors that may play a role in a fire season's severity. The outbreak in Alberta may have been influenced by low snowpack or early melt, contributing to overall dry conditions -- but as Martell pointed out, low humidity and high winds were also important factors. And the way the rest of the season plays out will depend on similar conditions, including temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind speeds.

These are all factors that scientists believe have been influenced by climate change over the past few decades and will likely continue to change in the future. Fire seasons in both Canada and Alaska have lengthened in recent years as blazes break out earlier and earlier -- and as temperatures continue to rise in the coming decades, these seasons may become even longer and potentially more intense.  

As far as the rest of this year's Northern fire season goes, concerns are already running high -- in addition to Alberta's severe start to the season, Alaska, which experienced one of its worst fire seasons ever last year, just saw its warmest April on record. (And, in fact, the state's fire season has already gotten an early start, with first wildfire of the year breaking out at the end of February). But, according to Martell, moderate weather and more rainfall later in the spring and summer could still cause conditions to calm down this year. For now, it's a wait-and-see game.

Overall, though, while it's notoriously difficult to pin any single incident on climate change, the events in Alberta can safely be taken as the latest symptom in a much broader pattern -- one that, thanks to the ongoing effects of climate change, may continue to build in the coming years.",high,test
135,"Obama Makes Case Against Donald Trump, Saying Presidency ""Is Not a Reality Show""

President Obama implored journalists on Friday to subject Donald J. Trump's statements and proposals to intense scrutiny now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee for president, saying the 2016 White House campaign should not be treated like a political carnival.

""We are in serious times, and this is a really serious job,"" Mr. Obama said after being asked about Mr. Trump at a news conference. ""This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States. Every candidate, every nominee, needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny.""

And he said Republican voters must now confront the choice they made in the primaries.

""Their standard-bearer at the moment is Donald Trump,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Republican voters are going to have to make a decision about whether this is the guy who speaks for them and represents their values.""

In particular, he added, ""Republican women, voters, are going to have to decide, ""Is that the guy I feel comfortable with representing me and what I care about?' ""

Taking questions from reporters at the White House for the first time since Mr. Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee on Tuesday, the president said he was concerned that coverage of Mr. Trump and other candidates had emphasized ""the spectacle and the circus"" instead of the serious issues at stake for the country.

The comments were a preview of what aides say will be a vigorous presence by Mr. Obama in the general election campaign. Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama have a tense history that includes Mr. Trump's decision to lead the ""birther"" movement that questioned where the president was born.

On Friday, Mr. Obama's comments about Mr. Trump were restrained in tone. But he made it clear he believed that Mr. Trump's proposals and statements would not hold up to scrutiny.

""He has a long record that needs to be examined,"" he said, adding that candidates who said things that could ""threaten war"" or had the ""potential for upending our critical relationships with other countries"" needed to be critically examined.

Asked a moment later about Mr. Trump's Twitter post on Thursday of himself eating a taco bowl, Mr. Obama seemed amused.

""I have no thoughts on Mr. Trump's tweets,"" he said. ""As a general rule, I don't pay attention to Mr. Trump's tweets.""

Mr. Obama also said he was pleased that the United States economy had added 160,000 jobs in April, though he cautioned that ""the global economy, as many people here are aware, is not growing as fast as it should be.""

He said his administration was taking actions to crack down on tax evasion like the kind exposed by the so-called Panama Papers. He said the new rules would help regulators track the flow of money by requiring banking institutions to report the real names of people who open accounts.

But he called on Congress to broaden those efforts through legislation, saying, ""We're not going to be able to complete this job unless Congress acts as well.""",high,test
136,"Uber Mexico City driver accused of rape detained by prosecutors

A driver for ride-hailing app Uber was detained in Mexico City after a female passenger accused him of raping her, a spokeswoman from the city's prosecutor's office said on Friday.

The passenger said she was raped earlier in May after being picked up by the Uber driver in the upmarket Condesa neighborhood, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be identified. The driver was detained on Wednesday and is now being held in a prison in Mexico City, the spokeswoman said.

""We take accusations like this very seriously and thus have deactivated the platform of the driver,"" Uber spokesman Luis de Uriarte, who is based in Mexico, said in a statement.

He confirmed that authorities had asked the company for information about a driver and a journey made by that driver.

The company's Mexico City operation, its largest in Latin America, has often been cited by Uber officials as an example of progress for the city's decision to regulate the service. The company has more than 39,000 drivers in Mexico and more than 1.2 million active users.

137,"Brazil Senate Committee Votes for Rousseff to Stand Trial

A Senate committee recommended on Friday that Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff be put on trial by the full chamber for breaking budget laws, moving a step closer to the likely suspension of the leftist leader from office next week.

Despite renewed promised by Rousseff on Friday to resist her removal, her chances for staying in office are dimming. Her departure would come at a time when a majority of Brazilians are against Rousseff because of an economic recession and a massive corruption scandal that has exposed wrongdoing by ruling party officials.

The full Senate is expected to vote to put her on trial on Wednesday, which would immediately suspend Rousseff for the duration of a trial that could last six months. During that period, Vice President Michel Temer would replace her as acting president.

The upper house committee voted 15-5 to accept the charges against Rousseff, which involve budget irregularities that critics say masked budget problems while she ran for re-election in 2014, and her opponents are certain to muster the simple majority needed to begin a trial.

""I will resist until the last day,"" Rousseff said at an event where she announced the delivery of low-cost housing. The president said she would not resign because she committed no crime, and called her looming ouster a ""coup d'etat.""

If the Senate convicts Rousseff, by a two-thirds majority vote to oust her, Temer would serve out the remainder of Rousseff's second term through 2018.

Local newspaper surveys say the opposition has 50 of the 54 votes needed, with many of the 10 undecided senators likely to favor her ouster.

Rousseff has struggled to survive politically in the face of Brazil's biggest ever corruption scandal and its worst recession since the 1930s. Her removal would mark an end to 13 years of leftist rule by the Workers Party that began in 2003 under her mentor, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

While Rousseff is not directly accused of corruption, Brazil's top prosecutor has asked for her to be investigated for obstructing justice in the kickback scandal that has engulfed state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and fueled Brazil's political crisis.

In a separate initiative launched by the opposition, Rousseff's 2014 re-election campaign is being investigated by an electoral court for alleged funding with bribe money.

At Rousseff's presidential palace Friday, officials had glum faces and appeared resigned to the end of her administration.

One aide denied they were packing up already, but added: ""No doubt, we have to start organizing things.""

Echoing the sense of an administration that has run out of time, no reporters showed up for a news conference called by Women Affairs Secretary Eleonora Menicucci, a close Rousseff aide. She ended up speaking only to a government television camera.

Rousseff's supporters on the Senate committee have called for annulment of the impeachment proceedings because the man who launched them last year, lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha, was himself removed from office on Thursday by the Supreme Court for obstructing the investigation of corruption accusations against him.

The top court has so far dismissed all government requests to halt the impeachment proceedings.

Workers Party Senator Lindbergh Farias said the ouster of Rousseff was aimed at undoing Lula's work to help the poor, and at rolling back workers' benefits, privatising state companies and aligning Brazil's foreign policy closer to the United States.",high,test

They join the six inaugural titles from 2015: Doom, Pong, Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros, Tetris and World of Warcraft.

Titles are selected for the US-based museum based on their status among players, longevity and influence.

The winning games were selected from 15 finalists, which included Final Fantasy, Tomb Raider and the original Pokemon games.

The inductees span genres, decades and platforms but ""all have significantly affected the video game industry, popular culture, and society in general,"" the museum said.

""Although a handful of shooter games preceded Space Invaders, its runaway success, innovative features, compelling graphics, and elemental themes captured the public imagination, spurring many imitators and a craze for arcade games,"" said Jeremy Saucier, assistant director of The Strong's International Centre for the History of Electronic Games (ICHEG).

Oregon Trail, in which the player controls a wagon of settlers crossing the West in the early days of American settlement, is fondly remembered by many for its fun approach to education as well as its difficulty, which saw players frequently ""die"" of dysentery.

""Virtual dollhouse""

Grand Theft Auto III, a game with violence and mature themes, made headlines when it was released in 2001. It was a big commercial success, selling 14 million copies.

""Grand Theft Auto III renewed debates about the role of games and violence in society while it signalled video games aren't just for kids,"" Mr Saucier said.

The Legend of Zelda and Sonic the Hedgehog were the first entries in long-running franchises for Nintendo and Sega respectively, and remain popular today. Both games spawned multiple sequels and spinoffs, including cartoon series.

The Sims, released in 2000, was described by the museum as a ""virtual dollhouse game"" in which players manipulate digital characters to create their own stories.

""The game has had universal appeal, with female players outnumbering males, and adults as passionate about the game as children,"" said ICHEG director Jon-Paul Dyson.

""By turning the computer into a toy to explore the complexity of the human experience, The Sims radically expanded the notion of what a game could be.""",high,test

First assault charge to be brought after New Year's Eve attacks in German city dropped after witnesses fail to recognise defendant

The first sexual assault charge to be brought after the New Year's Eve attacks in Cologne has been dropped after witnesses failed to recognise the defendant.

The 26-year-old Algerian, named only as Farouk B, appeared in court in Cologne charged with sexually assaulting and stealing a phone from two women at the German city's main railway station on New Year's Eve. 

Farouk and his 23-year-old brother, who was charged with theft, were accused of being part of a group of about 10 men who attacked a woman in a crowd in the station.

According to the charge sheet, several perpetrators surrounded the woman ""with sexual motivation"" for two or three minutes, during which the suspect allegedly groped her the buttocks and hip and attempted to grab her breast.

But the prosecution's two witnesses and alleged victims, Karin P and Cordula M, failed to recognise Farouk in court, prompting the prosecutor to drop the sexual assault charge. The court spokesman Wolfgang Schorn said the witnesses had ""70%"" identified Farouk B two weeks ago from a photograph.

Schorn said Karin P's phone had been found with other phones among Farouk's possessions in a refugee home where he was staying. Both men denied they were at the station on New Year's Eve and said they had bought the phones.

The two men were convicted of theft and receiving stolen goods, and each sentenced to six months on probation. The prosecution had called for seven-month prison sentences.

Police said they had previously been arrested for breaking into a car, a charge they both admitted.

The state prosecutor later told the news magazine Focus that the pair would remain in custody pending deportation, as they had entered Germany illegally last November and not applied for asylum. According to their defence lawyer, Bernhard Scholz, they had ""not bothered to try to get papers"". ""They wanted to travel on to England,"" Scholz told Focus.

""The court and the state prosecution have proved they are independent,"" Scholz added. ""They have not allowed themselves to be influenced by public pressure.""

It was the first sexual assault case connected with the apparently coordinated New Year's Eve attacks, which created a storm of media outrage in Germany in January.

Cologne prosecutors received 1,170 criminal complaints related to the attacks, of which 492 were reports of sexual assaults.

There have been nine convictions for theft, but this is one of only two cases where a sexual assault suspect has been identified. The other was a 19-year-old Moroccan man who was arrested in Switzerland last week after being caught shoplifting.",high,test
141,"Panama Papers Source Offers to Aid Investigators if He's Not Punished

The anonymous source behind the huge leak of documents known as the Panama Papers has offered to aid law enforcement officials in prosecutions related to offshore money laundering and tax evasion, but only if he is assured that he will not be punished.

""Legitimate whistle-blowers who expose unquestionable wrongdoing, whether insiders or outsiders, deserve immunity from government retribution,"" the source, who has still not revealed a name or nationality, said in a statement issued Thursday night.

The documents, which list the true owners of thousands of companies created to hide the people behind them, expose the holdings of current and former world leaders and other prominent figures. The source, who uses the pseudonym John Doe but whose gender is not known, said that the papers could spur thousands of prosecutions, ""if only law enforcement could access and evaluate the actual documents.""

He noted that journalists who have viewed the papers have said they will not turn over the full archive of 11.5 million documents. ""I, however, would be willing to cooperate with law enforcement to the extent that I am able,"" he wrote.

The statement, which was issued Thursday night under the condition that it not be reported until Friday morning, gave some hints about his political views and concerns. They include income inequality, the American campaign finance system and the ""revolving door"" of United States officials who take jobs at banks or other companies they once regulated.

""Banks, financial regulators and tax authorities have failed,"" the statement said. ""Decisions have been made that have spared the wealthy while focusing instead on reining in middle- and low-income citizens.""

Most of the revelations so far have involved wealthy foreigners and political players overseas. The statement came on the same day that the Obama administration, citing the disclosures, announced a series of steps intended to prevent wealthy individuals, including political leaders, from using offshore shell companies to hide assets, embezzle money or avoid paying taxes.

The proposals would create a centralized federal registry of the actual owners behind any newly established corporation, and they would mandate that financial institutions collect and maintain information on these owners as bank accounts are being set up. The moves would make it easier to investigate financial fraud.

""Our financial system should not provide the rich, the powerful and the corrupt with the opportunity to shield their assets and avoid paying their fair share or with the opportunity to hide any illicit activity,"" said Wally Adeyemo, the deputy national security adviser for international economics. ""Nobody should be able to play by a different set of rules.""

The statement by the Panama Papers source was released through the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, which originally received the once-confidential archive of documents taken from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the newspaper who received the original leak with his colleague Frederik Obermaier, wrote in a blog post that he had confirmed via encrypted chat that the statement had come from the same person -- of unknown nationality -- who provided the secret documents.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung, working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a Washington-based group made up of more than 100 news media organizations, published articles about the Panama Papers starting last month that have set off political furors and unsettled financial institutions around the world.

According to the consortium, the documents reveal the hidden assets of 12 current and former world leaders, 128 other politicians and officials, and a range of sports figures and celebrities. The 214,000 shadow companies described in the documents are tied to people in more than 200 countries and territories. The papers include long chains of emails showing how the companies have been used.

News reports based on the documents have linked $2 billion in assets to a childhood friend of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and disclosed the holdings of the Aliyev family, which has long held power in Azerbaijan. The prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, said he would temporarily step aside after the revelation that he and his wife owned an offshore company.

The statement from the confidential source said he was not and had never been a government official or contractor.

He was extremely critical of the news media, suggesting that certain unnamed news organizations had declined initial offers from him to take and report on the documents.

The measures announced on Thursday by the Obama administration, which in most cases have been in the works for years, would try to combat illegal tax shelters with a collection of new tools.

The centralized federal registry of the actual owners behind any newly established corporation -- the most far-reaching of the proposals -- could be established only if Congress passed legislation, which is unlikely in this election year. Legislation that is already pending in Congress would require the reporting of similar ownership information when new companies are set up, but the information would be filed at the Treasury Department only if individual states did not collect it on their own.

Separately, the administration announced on Thursday that it had completed a rule, after four years of effort, that would require banks and other financial institutions in the United States to collect and keep accurate records on these same ""beneficial owners"" after they opened a new bank account.

The rule mandates that banks know the identity of anyone who owns at least 25 percent of a legal entity or who ""controls"" it, information that again could be provided to law enforcement investigators looking into fraud allegations.

Treasury officials also called on Congress, after several years of delay, to ratify eight separate tax treaties with nations such as Luxembourg and Switzerland. The agreements would increase the amount of information that tax enforcement authorities in the various countries could share as they tried to crack down on illegal efforts to hide money.

And the Treasury Department proposed a regulation that would allow it to mandate that foreign-owned companies set up in the United States, like companies based here, register with the Internal Revenue Service. That would allow the federal government to determine whether the companies owed any taxes to the United States or whether they might have been set up to illegally shield the owners from having to pay taxes overseas.

Stefanie Ostfeld, the acting head of the United States branch of a nonprofit group called Global Witness, which has pushed for financial transparency laws, welcomed the moves by the Obama administration but said they were not necessarily sufficient.

Many owners would remain hidden, she said, given that under the rules only individuals who own more than 25 percent of a company would have to identify themselves to banks.

""This is an important step to getting dirty money out of the financial system,"" she said. ""But there appear to be weaknesses in the regulation that provide would-be money launderers with a blueprint for how to structure companies to avoid detection and continue to have access to American banks.""",high,test

Comedian Arsenio Hall has filed a defamation lawsuit against the singer Sinead O'Connor, who accused him of supplying drugs to music legend Prince, whose death on April 21 has prompted speculation about an overdose.

The $5 million lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, refers to O'Connor as a ""desperate attention-seeker"" and claims Hall and O'Connor have not spoken in 25 years.

Prince was discovered on April 21 at Paisley Park, his home-studio complex in a Minneapolis suburb. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told prescription opioid drugs were found at the scene, and Minnesota media said the painkiller Percocet was found in his system.

146,"US airlines enlist travelers in effort to cut security lines

U.S. airlines have been pressing the government to act to reduce the intolerably long security lines at the nation's airports. Now, they're even asking passengers for help by sharing their frustration on social media.

Lines during peak hours at some airports have topped 90 minutes. The airlines already are warning customers to arrive at the airport two hours in advance, and are fearful the situation will only get worse with a record number of travelers expected this summer.

Earlier this week, the Transportation Security Administration said it would increase staffing at security checkpoints and boost the number of bomb-sniffing dogs to help the lines move more quickly. The agency also is asking Congress for more money to hire additional screeners and pay existing ones overtime.

Both sides have encouraged travelers to enroll in the TSA's expedited screening program called PreCheck. But the airlines also want travelers to do something that comes more naturally: complain.

Airlines for America, the industry's trade group, just launched a website called iHateTheWait.com , encouraging fliers to post photos of the lines on Twitter and Instagram along with the hashtag #iHateTheWait. Presumably this will make Congress more aware of the problem -- and let fellow travelers know what they're in for when they get to the airport.

The group's spokeswoman Jean Medina, said the campaign is ""raising awareness of the issue and serving as crowd-sourced (wait time) information.""

While the number of travelers is on the rise, there are fewer agents to screen them. The number of front-line screeners was cut by 10 percent in the past three years, based on the assumption that travelers would enroll in PreCheck. They did not.

The airline trade group, which represents Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Hawaiian Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, said on the iHateTheWait website that engaging in the social media campaign will ""help cut wait times for everyone who flies.""

TSA spokesman Michael England would not comment about the site but said the TSA's goal is to keep all passengers safe and suggests that passengers get to the airport two hours early for domestic flights.",high,test

Donald Trump will testify after the Nov. 8 presidential election in a class-action lawsuit that accuses him and his now-defunct Trump University of defrauding people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars, media reports said on Friday, citing his attorney.

Court documents showed a federal judge ordered the trial to start in San Diego on Nov. 28. This raised the possibility that Trump could take the stand as president-elect but also ensured that he will not have to testify in the case while he campaigns.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee plans to attend much of the trial and would take the witness stand, Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times.

Petrocelli did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit claim the school lured ""student-victims"" into its doors, only to defraud them once their checks were cashed.

Another Trump lawyer, Alan Garten, last year called the allegations ""totally lacking in any merit"" and said that Trump would prevail in the end ""whether it be by motion or at trial.""

Trump also faces another lawsuit in Manhattan over Trump University brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which Garten has said is ""politically motivated."" Schneiderman is a Democrat.

149,"Clinton ends her swing through California with a visit to Oakland to marshal her troops

Hillary Clinton finished her swing through California on Friday with a rally, a visit to her Oakland field office and a series of fundraisers -- a triple-barreled approach to campaigning in the Bay Area.

Hundreds of supporters gathered at a school to hear Clinton rail against Donald Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee this week when his final rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, dropped out of the race.

The Democratic front-runner reminded her audience that Trump had pledged to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and suggested that women should be punished for having abortions, a stance he later reversed.

Clinton reserved some of her harshest comments for Trump's behavior toward women.

""He doesn't think much of equal pay for women, because he doesn't think much of women,"" she said.

There was no mention of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination. He has pressed on with his campaign, despite having little chance of closing the delegate gap.

Before speaking at the Oakland rally, Clinton visited her downtown field office, the first of several the candidate has opened around the state. It was plastered with placards and homemade signs, and buzzing with volunteers.

Although California's primary is still a month away, mail-in ballots already are being distributed and supporters have been dialing voters in hopes of securing their support.

""We treat every day from May 7 to June 7 as election day,"" said Arielle Goren, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman.

The campaign will be training volunteers on Saturday in Oakland, and they'll be enlisting female supporters to reach out to female voters on Mother's Day.

Reena Sekhon-Johl, 36, who lives in nearby Pleasanton, said she signed up to volunteer a few weeks ago after a distressing conversation with a longtime friend who is supporting Trump.

""I donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign. I bought a shirt. I signed up to volunteer,"" she said.

Sekhon-Johl said she hoped Democrats would unite around the party's nominee after the prolonged primary rivalry.

""We are not a 'Hillary or bust' campaign,"" she said. ""We are for what's best for the nation.""

It was a common theme among Clinton's volunteers here, who often spoke positively about Sanders while expressing hopes that his supporters would eventually rally behind Clinton.

""We need to be united,"" said Juan Cerda, 32, of San Francisco. ""It's about bringing a great coalition together.""

Cerda volunteered for Clinton in Iowa and brought his parents from Bakersfield to the Oakland field office to help make phone calls. His father, David Cerda, 66, a mechanic, said Clinton was the right candidate for farm workers.

""They want something new, they want someone to help their sons and daughters to have a better life,"" he said.

Clinton signed his hat as she shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.

Speaking alongside Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Clinton urged the volunteers to ""reach out to as many California voters as you possibly can.""

""I cannot do it without you,"" she said. ""We still have some work to do to remind people there's a big primary.""",high,test
150,"Philippine foreign reserves up to 83.47 bln dollars in April

The Philippine gross international reserves (GIR) surged to 83.47 billion U.S. dollars in April, the local central bank said Friday.

The GIR level in April was higher by 0.49 billion U.S. dollars than the March figures of 82.98 billion U.S. dollars, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said.

The increase was mainly due to the revaluation gains on the BSPs gold holdings resulting from the increase in the price of gold in the international market, net foreign currency deposits by the National Government, as well as the BSPs income from investments abroad.

These were partially offset by payments made by the government for its maturing foreign exchange obligations.

The central bank said the April GIR level can cover 10.4 months worth of imports of goods and payments of services and income.

It is also equivalent to 5.5 times the countrys short-term external debt based on original maturity and 4.1 times based on residual maturity, the agency added.",high,test

""We were hoping that people would see Barack attempt as a desperate attempt to get some special favours from Cameron, but ultimately people were completely blinded by his chilled demeanour around the royal family and photos of him with prince George.""

Initially buoyed by the scheduling clash between the vote and Glastonbury, the mood in the out camp is fading fast.

""Things looked pretty good at the start, we worked hard to get the vote scheduled on the same day as Glastonbury.

""It allows us to cage and contain up to 120,000 hippies who won't be able to vote at the event. These windbags support peace, love, harmony amongst nations and a load of other rubbish, so were bound to vote to stay in.""

152,"Meet the site that is like Uber -- but for tractors

Jordan Hickel has a long row of ultra-expensive tractors and other machinery parked on his farm in central Kansas.

""There's well over a million dollars of equipment out here,"" the 31-year-old farmer said, waving his hand at the vehicles while walking toward the crown jewel of his collection: A bright red 8120 CASE IH combine that he uses to harvest corn, soybeans, alfalfa and wheat.

But Hickel uses the towering machine only two months out of the year.

This summer, he's shipping the combine off to Colorado then Washington state -- renting it out to other farmers through a website that hopes to bring the sharing economy to the farmstead.

Think Uber -- but for tractors.

The site, MachineryLink Sharing, is the brainchild of a Kansas City company that started about 15 years ago as a traditional combine leasing business. Last year it launched the website that helps farmers make money by renting their equipment to those who can't afford the cost of buying the machines outright.

""This is a big idea,"" said MachineryLink president Jeff Dema -- and one that comes as growers are struggling in the face of low crop prices that the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects will help make 2016 the least profitable year for America's farm sector in more than a decade.

The platform now has more than 1,200 users and features ""tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment,"" according to the company. Listings show several hundred different tractors, planters and combines available for rent around the country.

Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, who will soon release a book about the sharing economy, said the approach has a lot of potential.

""The pure peer-to-peer rental model works well when you have high-value assets that aren't being utilized at capacity,"" he explained. One of the reasons services like Airbnb and Uber have taken off is because they've let normal people make money from their biggest investments -- their cars and homes, he said.

On the farm, equipment is often the second-largest expense after land -- and there is a lot of it out there: According to the latest USDA farm census, there's $244 billion worth of machinery and equipment spread across America's farms.

Combines are big-ticket items -- a loaded, top-of-the-line model can retail for $500,000. Even Hickel's machine, a 2010 model he bought used last spring, was a big investment, he said.

""It's not the sort of thing you buy without checking in with your wife,"" he joked.

Hickel's combine is listed on the site for $1,800 per day -- and it's already booked for 20 days by farmers in Colorado and Washington in July, when his own first round of harvesting should already be done.

Farmers have long shared or rented out equipment locally, but the tight timelines of a growing season make that hard because almost everyone in the same area needs the same equipment at the same time. MachineryLink Sharing lets people look outside their neighborhood , according to Dema.

""If you look two or three states away, all the sudden you have people who are on different crops and growing cycles,"" he said.

Of course, that's a lot of distance to cover -- and renters are responsible for transporting the equipment in addition to booking fees, which can add thousands of dollars to the total cost of a rental.

Still, farmers often find they can save money by renting rather than buying, Dema said. And MachineryLink can help with moving logistics -- relying on relationships from the company's traditional combine leasing business, he said. The company, which takes a 15 percent cut of the each transaction made through the site, also secures the payment, verifies that renters have insurance that will cover the machinery while it's in use, and provides another umbrella insurance policy to reassure equipment owners like Hickel.

""You want to make sure the person renting your equipment won't damage it or run off with it,"" said Sundararajan.

That was certainly a concern for Hickel, who said he had been looking for ways to rent his machines to other farmers before he heard about MachineryLink Sharing, but had felt uneasy about turning the keys over to a stranger who lives several states away.

MachineryLink hopes to address those fears with a rating system similar to those used by services like Airbnb and Uber: After a rental, both sides of the deal will rate each other on a scale of five stars. ""If you have one or two stars, you might as well take your listing off the site. No one is going to rent it from you,"" said Dema of the feature, which is in development.

The Colorado farmer who booked Hickel's combine for this summer was looking for a few more machines to rent. Hickel mentioned the search to some neighbors who have two similar combines, and now those machines are set to be shipped off to the same renter, he said.

The money from those bookings will help pad the margins of what can otherwise be a risky business -- one where each season leaves farmers at the mercy of both the weather and a volatile commodities market.

Hickel himself is a fourth-generation farmer who has experienced the ups and downs of living off the land.

""I was driving a tractor when I was 9 and started running a combine when I was 12,"" he said. ""I lived and breathed the farm -- I didn't want to do anything but farm."" Then when Hickel was in high school, his family sold off their farm after a few rough years.

He got back into farming on his own after college, but his family's earlier challenges helped him think through what he needed to do to stay afloat -- including finding new revenue streams like renting equipment out, Hickel said.

""When you get to look back and see what we should've done or could've done, you start to know what you should do now,"" he said.",high,test

157,"Not just eye candy - Activision's ad revenue bet with King Digital

Activision Blizzard Inc is sweet on mobile advertising.

The new owner of King Digital could soon start displaying mobile ads in King's games as it looks to target the 463 million players who access games such as ""Candy Crush"" and ""Farm Heroes"" on their smartphones.

Activision closed its nearly $6 billion acquisition of King in February, becoming the world's biggest game network, but sparked concerns that it was overpaying for a company with just one blockbuster game series - ""Candy Crush"".

Now, with in-game advertising, Activision is set to tap a big revenue opportunity that should put to rest all doubts.

""Given our massive network, we do believe that advertising could be a meaningful revenue stream for King in the long term,"" King's Chief Executive Riccardo Zacconi said on Activision's earnings call on Thursday.

Zacconi said King's gamers were one of the ""largest untapped audiences for advertisers in the world"" and the company had started experimenting with advertising in two games.

He, however, said it was early days and didn't expect any impact to this year's results.

As an independent company, King used to run ads in its games until 2013. It stopped them to offer an ad-free gaming experience to better compete with ""Farmville"" creator Zynga Inc.

""I think one of the first things (King) will do is they'll have some type of incentive ad, where if you run out of lives it'll go hey, if you watch this 30-second video, we'll give you two more lives,"" Cowen and Co analyst Doug Creutz told Reuters.

If King carries video ads, that would be a huge opportunity for them, said Harish Thimmappa, senior director of social sales at marketing-technology company Kenshoo.

King, whose players are primarily female, generated just 1 percent of its 2013 revenue of $1.88 billion from advertising.

For Activision, though, the opportunity could be much bigger, at least $500 million annually, analysts said.

CALL OF OPPORTUNITY

Activision on Thursday reported first-quarter profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street expectations, helped by strong demand for its popular ""Call of Duty: Black Ops III"" videogame and the inclusion of King's financials.

Activision shares closed up 8.5 percent at $37.87 on Friday. The stock had risen more than 50 percent in the past 12 months.

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said he expected King to begin advertising by the end of this year, but generate significantly higher earnings from it in 2017.

""We believe Activision Blizzard could earn well in excess of $3.00 by 2018 if it optimizes King's untapped advertising opportunity and unlocks deal synergies, suggesting its stock is significantly undervalued,"" said Pachter who has an ""outperform"" rating on Activision's stock.

U.S. troops have been on the ground in Yemen for approximately two weeks supporting Yemeni and Emirati forces that are fighting a pitched battle against al-Qaeda militants near the city of Mukalla, Pentagon officials said Friday.

U.S. military activity in Yemen has been relegated mostly to airstrikes for more than a year following the overthrow of the government in the capital Sanaa by Houthi rebels, but Friday's announcement signals a new level of involvement in the conflict -- one that the Pentagon described as temporary without putting a timeline on it.

The U.S. forces are working with Yemeni forces loyal to the old government, not the Houthis, officials said. The officials also said that the actions U.S. forces are engaged in are focused on al-Qaeda and are separate from a Saudi-led campaign against the Houthis. The United States has assisted the Saudi-led coalition with midair refueling aircraft and some reconnaissance capabilities.

Davis would not describe what type of U.S. personnel were on the ground.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday issued its long-awaited final rule that bans the sale of e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah tobacco and pipe tobacco to people under age 18.

Under the rule, retailers will be required to verify the age of purchasers by photo identification and the sale of covered tobacco products in vending machines will be prohibited unless the machine is located in an adult-only facility.

The new requirements, which will go into effect in 90 days, also ban the distribution of free samples.

""Before today, there was no federal law prohibiting retailers from selling e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco or cigars to people under age 18,"" the FDA said in a statement. ""Today's rule changes that ... bringing them in line with other tobacco products the FDA has regulated.""

In addition, all tobacco products brought to the market after Feb. 15, 2007, which include all e-cigarettes, must submit new tobacco product applications and show they ""meet the applicable public health standard set forth in the law,"" the U.S. agency said.

The FDA said it will allow manufacturers to continue selling their products for up to two years while they submit their applications and then for an additional year while it reviews the submissions.

""The FDA will issue an order granting marketing authorization where appropriate; otherwise, the product will face FDA enforcement,"" it added.

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States and responsible for 480,000 deaths per year.

While there has been a significant decline in the use of traditional cigarettes among U.S. youth over the past decade, their use of other tobacco products continues to climb.

A recent survey supported by the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed current e-cigarette use among high school students has skyrocketed from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 16 percent in 2015 and hookah use has risen significantly.

""As cigarette smoking among those under 18 has fallen, the use of other nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, has taken a drastic leap. All of this is creating a new generation of Americans who are at risk of addiction,"" said Sylvia Burwell, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. ""Today's announcement is an important step in the fight for a tobacco-free generation.""

Now that Donald Trump has effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, he has indicated that he will try to unify his 16 former opponents behind his candidacy. Or at least unify the four of them who didn't say really, really mean things about him during the campaign.

So far, none of Trump's former major rivals have endorsed him, except for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Dr. Ben Carson.

But now Trump will be getting a boost from a Democratic rival. A source close to the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders discloses that Sanders will soon announce that he is suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump.

Sanders has told his advisors that he is fed up with Sen. Hillary Clinton's continued ties with Wall Street. He is particularly angered by Clinton's large speaking fees. ""Hell,"" said Sanders to one aide, ""I can't even afford a suit made of natural fiber, and that bitch is raking in a million bucks for a 10-minute speech to Goldman Sachs. They didn't even bribe Ted Cruz that much, and his wife works there.""

In response to staff protests over how he could possibly support a candidate with Trump's views, Sanders responded, ""I have no chance to beat Hillary now. To do that, I would need to flip her superdelegates. But the superdelegates were all paid off by George Soros to support Hillary. Or maybe it was George Clooney who paid them. I don't remember. Either way, she has them in her pocket. Trump may be a one-percenter and a crook, but at least he's not a Wall Street crook.""

Sanders continued, ""Trump doesn't stand for anything except promoting himself. If we start saying nice things about him, he'll adopt our positions on the issues. Putin tried the same tactic, and now Donald wants to abandon NATO. No reason that he won't do likewise by us.""

During a ceremony to mark the beginning of the commercial operation of the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant, the president commented on the decision to suspend Cunha's term and remove him from the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies.

""I heard the Supreme Court had suspended Mister Eduardo Cunha, alleging that he was using his position for coercion and blackmail. Better late than ever. The only thing I regret is that he succeeded in presiding over the regrettable impeachment process in the House,"" she said.

As the House speaker, despite being implicated in several wrongdoings himself, Cunha accepted the impeachment request against Rousseff and presided over the House session in which the impeachment was approved on April 17.

According to the government, the fact that a person accused of many wrongdoings presided over an impeachment process is another reflection of the legal frailty.

Cunha was suspended preliminarily from his position early on Thursday by head of Supreme Court Teori Zavascki, who accepted an injunction filed by chief prosecutor Rodrigo Janot.

According to Janot, Cunha was using his position to obstruct investigations of the Lava Jato Operation, which was uncovered as a major corruption scheme at Petrobras.

Later in the day, the decision was voted by all 11 Supreme Court judges. They unanimously decided to suspend Cunha, agreeing that his permanence in the House Speaker's position was hindering the investigations.

Cunha was also being investigated by the House Ethics Committee, as he was accused of participating in the Petrobras corruption scheme by taking millions of dollars in favoring specific companies in Petrobras contracts.",high,test

165,"Skin bacteria stay ""stable over time""

Everyone has their own personal range of bacteria living on their skin that stays largely unchanged over time, a US study suggests.

It found sites of oily skin, such as backs and ears, had the most stable microbial fingerprints.

But even exposed dry sites such as palms were relatively stable.

Feet were among the areas that changed most in their microbial make-up, perhaps due to factors such as personal hygiene.

Human skin is home to a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Most are harmless or even beneficial, but some have been linked with skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis and eczema.

Research into how skin bugs vary across the body helps explain why eczema tends to affect moist sites such as the bends of the arms, while psoriasis commonly occurs on dry exposed areas such as the elbows.

But it has been unclear how communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi found across the skin vary over time and how these changes might affect health.

Microbial signatures

In a study published in the journal, Cell, researchers took skin samples from 12 healthy people at three times over a period of one month to two years, encompassing 17 areas of the body.

Heidi Kong, of the National Cancer Institute, and Julie Segre, of the National Human Genome Research Institute, found healthy individuals kept their own unique microbial signatures despite exposure to clothes, washing, other people and the outside world.

However, the stability of skin bugs varied among individuals and microbial strains, with some showing more changes than others.

In the future, the scientists plan to study patients with eczema and other conditions to look at how microbes might vary with disease.

""Future studies can use the knowledge of the relative stability of the skin microbial communities in healthy adults to understand how various exposures or disease state may alter these skin microbes,"" said Dr Segre.

""For example, studies in acne patients could explore whether specific strains bloom during adolescent acne flares or change with medications such as antibiotics.""",high,test

168,"Millions of GM mosquitoes to fight Zika virus in Caymans

Biotech company Oxitec hopes to repeat a technique used in Brazil to reduce the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes

The British biotech company Oxitec and the Cayman Islands government announced plans on Thursday to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes in the fight against a species that spreads Zika and other diseases.

Deployment of the mosquitoes against the Aedes aegypti species in the Cayman Islands is a major advance for Oxitec, which has promoted the method heavily as an environmentally safe way to combat the vectors of mosquito-borne illnesses while confronting public concerns about the technology.

The company has deployed its mosquitoes to fight Zika in Brazil following initial trials there and previously conducted tests in the Cayman Islands and Panama. Oxitec and officials in the Florida Keys have proposed testing there as well and are awaiting US regulatory approval.

The Cayman government approved the full deployment after what they called a successful, peer-reviewed trial in 2010, Bill Petrie, the director of the British territory's Mosquito Research and Control Unit, said in a statement.

""We have wanted to remove this invasive pest for a long time but this has proven very difficult using currently available tools on an island the size of Grand Cayman, so we have been looking for new approaches,"" Petrie said.

Male mosquitoes do not bite. The company says its modified males will mate with females and produce offspring that will not survive to adulthood, which should dramatically reduce the population of the non-native, disease-spreading Aedes aegypti species in the territory.

Oxitec will begin releasing hundreds of thousands of modified mosquitoes a week on the island of Grand Cayman, home to about 50,000 people, starting in June and continuing for at least nine months, said Glen Slade, the company's head of business development.

The mosquitoes will not be used on the two smaller islands of the British territory, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, which do not have the Aedes aegypti. The company insists it is not possible for the mosquitoes to fly to other islands or to survive long in the environment if they were to be inadvertently transferred elsewhere. They predict a massive drop in the number of the targeted species on Grand Cayman.

""It's not unreasonable to think we might achieve elimination,"" Slade said.

The company has started outreach on Grand Cayman to address any public concerns. In Key West, Florida, public meetings about Oxitec's proposed trial there became so contentious that mosquito control officials requested law enforcement protection at an April meeting to discuss the issue.

Phil Goodman, chairman of the five-member Florida Keys Mosquito Control District board of commissioners, said the decision to use Oxitec's mosquitoes on Grand Cayman was good news for the prospects of a similar trial in Florida if it is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

""If everything continues to look good with this and we do get approval and the citizens agree to this, it's what would work here in the Keys,"" he said.

In February, the World Health Organisation said it was encouraging countries to conduct further trials of genetically modified mosquitoes to help tackle emerging illnesses such as Zika.

170,"Suspect arrested in Washington-area shootings that killed three

Police arrested a man on Friday suspected in three shootings over two days in the Washington, D.C. suburbs that killed three, wounded three and revived memories of the ""Beltway sniper"" attacks of 2002.

Eulalio Sevilla Tordil, 62, a police officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was arrested near the shopping center where the second of Friday's two shootings took place, police said.

He had been suspected of killing his wife and shooting a bystander on Thursday in Prince George's County, Maryland.

When a pair of shootings broke out in neighboring Montgomery County on Friday, investigators turned their attention to Tordil, who had threatened to commit ""suicide by cop,"" police said.

The first of Friday's incidents began with a confrontation in a parking lot at Westfield Montgomery Mall in affluent Bethesda, Maryland, where two men and a woman were shot, police said.

One of the men died, the other was in critical condition, and the woman's life was not considered in danger, said Assistant Chief Darryl McSwain of Montgomery County police.

The second shooting took place about half an hour later, killing a woman at the Aspen Hill Shopping Center in Silver Spring, some 8 miles (13 km) away.

Bethesda and Silver Spring are suburbs of Washington in Montgomery County, which neighbors Prince George's County.Tordil was an officer with Federal Protective Service and was known to carry a handgun, police said.

The victim of Thursday's shooting at High Point High School was Tordil's estranged wife, Gladys, who taught chemistry at another school nearby. Her daughters, Grace and Nikki, were students at High Point and their mother was picking them up when she was shot.

""We do have reason to believe that this incident, the one in Aspen Hill, potentially the one also in Prince George's County, in High Point, was in fact related,"" McSwain said.

Authorities had temporarily locked down 14 schools near Friday's shooting sites and all of the county's recreational facilities as a precaution.

Tordil was on leave, having surrendered his gun and badge, after his wife obtained a protective order to keep him away, an official with the service said.

Greeks have begun a three-day general strike in protest at further austerity measures that are being proposed in return for more bailout money.

Shipping, public transport and civil service departments were among sectors hit in a bid to stop the introduction of tax and pension changes.

The sudden 48-hour strike on Friday and Saturday was called in addition to action previously planned for Sunday.

Greece's left-led government is due to a vote on the tax changes on Sunday.

The next tranche of about $5bn is overdue, after talks with Greece's international lenders faltered over the pace of reforms.

Unions said a proposed overhaul of the pensions system and rises in social security contributions were designed to win favour with eurozone finance ministers, who are due to discuss Greece's bailout money on Monday.

Greece's largest labour union, the private sector GSEE, said the changes, were the ""last nail on the coffin"" for workers and pensioners. A spokesman said: ""They are trying to prove to the Eurogroup that they are good students but they are destroying Greece's social security system.""

In Athens, no public transport service was working on Friday morning as metro, tram, bus and rail workers refused to work.

Train services across the country were halted, and ferries linking mainland Greece to the islands remained anchored in port. The strike by the powerful PNO seafarers union's strike is set to last until Tuesday morning.

Air travel was not affected by the strike. Airport workers staged their own industrial action last month.

The nationwide strikes are the fourth to be called since Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's government won re-election after organising a referendum on the country's bailout.

172,"SpaceX rocket launches satellite, then lands on ship at sea

An unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Florida on Friday to put a communications satellite into orbit, then made a swift return landing on an ocean platform, a live webcast showed.

It was the second successful landing at sea for entrepreneur Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which intends to offer cut-rate launch services by re-using its rockets.

""Woohoo!!"" Musk wrote on social media website Twitter after the landing. ""May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar.""

SpaceX successfully landed a rocket on a floating landing pad in April after four failed attempts. Another Falcon rocket had touched down on a ground-based landing pad at Cape Canaveral in December.

Before Friday's launch SpaceX had downplayed expectations for the rocket's successful return.

The rocket flying on Friday was traveling twice as fast as the one that landed last month so it could deliver a hefty television broadcast satellite into an orbit more than 20,000 miles (32,200 km) beyond that of the International Space Station, which is about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.

The 23-story tall rocket lifted off from a seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 1:21 a.m. EDT.

Perched atop the booster was the JCSAT-14 satellite, owned by the Tokyo-based telecommunications company, SKY Perfect JSAT Corp, a new customer for SpaceX.

About 2-1/2 minutes after launch the rocket's first stage shut down, separated, flipped around and headed toward a so-called drone ship stationed more than 400 miles (650 km) off Florida's east coast in the Atlantic Ocean.

The rocket's second stage continued flying to deliver the 10,300-pound (4,700-kg) JCSAT-14 satellite into orbit.

The satellite, built by Space Systems Loral in Palo Alto, California, a subsidiary of MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates is designed to provide television, data and mobile communications services to customers across Asia, Russia and Oceania and the Pacific Islands.

Friday's launch was the fourth of more than a dozen flights planned this year by SpaceX, which has a backlog of more than $10 billion worth of launch orders from customers including NASA.

Last week SpaceX won its first contract to launch a U.S. military satellite, breaking a 10-year-old monopoly held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.",high,test

The Vietnam Stock Index or VN-Index, a capitalization-weighted index of all the companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, successfully conquered the 600-point threshold this week.

The index finished at 606.52 points in the last trading day of the week, successfully conquered the 600-point threshold after a long time in fluctuation.

Bank and textile sectors played a key role in driving the maket up after foreign investment continued to flow into the sectors, said local stock experts.

Among big gainers were banker Vietcombank (VCB), Eximbank (EIB), the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BID), Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (CTG), and textile firms Thanh Cong Textile Garment Investment Trading JSC (TCM), Mirae Joint Stock Company (KMR), and Everpia JSC (EVE).

Additionally, others listed companies with good performances during the first quarter of this year and good business news also helped lift the index. Property developer Vingroup JSC (VIC), Hoang Quan Consutling-Trading-Service Real Estate Corp (HQC), B?nh Minh Plastic JSC (BMP), Pha Lai Thermal Power JSC (PPC) were among best gainers.

The VN-Index closed at 606.52 points on Friday, up 5.01 points, or 0.83 percent, from the previous trading days close. From the previous weeks closing session, the index won 8.15 points, or 1.36 percent.

During the week, the index experienced three straight ups, posting the highest level of 606.52 points on Friday, and the lowest level of 599.07 points on Wednesday. In comparison, it ranged between 591.58 points and 598.48 points in the previous week.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung said on Friday that the source of millions of documents leaked to the German newspaper from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca had sent them a manifesto, saying his motivation was the ""scale of injustices"" the papers revealed.

The source had never before publicly stated why he leaked the documents, now known as the Panama Papers, said Sueddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), one of Germany's most reputable newspapers.

In an 1,800 word manifesto published on the SZ website on Friday, the source, calling himself ""John Doe"", praised others who have leaked secret and sensitive documents, such as Edward Snowden, who revealed details of the U.S. government's mass surveillance program.

""For his revelations about the National Security Agency (NSA), he deserves a hero's welcome and a substantial prize, not banishment,"" the source wrote.

He also said he would be willing to co-operate with law enforcement agencies.

He called on the European Commission, Britain, the United States and other nations to take steps to protect people who reveal private information about such sensitive issues rather than punishing them.

""Legitimate whistleblowers who expose unquestionable wrongdoing, whether insiders or outsiders, deserve immunity from government retribution, full stop,"" he said.

The source, who contacted the paper a year ago with an offer of encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, denied being a spy but said he had recognized the ""scale of injustices"" described in their contents.

The documents cover a period over almost 40 years, from 1977 until last December, and purport to show that some companies domiciled in tax havens were being used for suspected money laundering, arms and drug deals and tax evasion.

could not independently verify whether the source was the same person who leaked the original documents. The source's identity and gender is not known.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung spent more than a year, along with other media outlets and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, analyzing the huge cache of documents.

On Friday, Sueddeutsche Zeitung introduced the manifesto by saying: ""Now ""John Doe"", the anonymous source, has sent the SZ a manifesto, which can be read as an explanation of his actions - and as a call to action.""

The source welcomed the fact that the leak had triggered a debate on ""wrongdoing by the elite"" but said not enough action had been taken.

""For the record, I do not work for any government or intelligence agency, directly or as a contractor, and I never have,"" he said.

The source was critical of banks, financial regulators, tax authorities, the courts, and the legal profession, as well as the media, saying he had offered the documents to several major media outlets that had chosen not to cover them.

""The collective impact of these failures has been a complete erosion of ethical standards, ultimately leading to a novel system we still call Capitalism, but which is tantamount to economic slavery.""

The source ended the manifesto by saying ""inexpensive, limitless digital storage and fast internet connections"" should help digitize the revolution against income inequality.",high,test

180,"Max Scherzer gives up four HRs as Cubs hold off Nationals, 8-6

The wind was blowing out at Wrigley Field on Friday afternoon for the first time all season, and the sun was shining and warm -- perfect conditions for a home run derby. The Chicago Cubs won the slugfest, four home runs to two. The Washington Nationals fell again, 8-6.

The wind could not explain the four home runs Max Scherzer allowed, all hit well enough to fly out without it. Scherzer was at a loss to explain it as well. Bad location? A great lineup? One rough day?

""I just felt like they had a better approach than I did. I felt like I was predictable, and they were just able to kind of key on that,"" Scherzer said. ""It's almost like they had a better understanding of me than me.""

The Cubs these days are forcing everyone to reevaluate, running away from the National League with the best pitching staff and most productive offense in baseball. They seem to have everyone figured out, from their nearest divisional challengers to these Nationals, who entered this series with the second-best record in the majors but have not fared better than anyone else.

Cubs second baseman Ben Zobrist buried them again Friday, hitting two of those four Cubs home runs after driving in four of Chicago's five runs Thursday. Tommy La Stella and Anthony Rizzo also homered for the Cubs, who drove Scherzer's season home run total to nine in seven starts -- a third of what he allowed all of last season.

Four of the seven hits Scherzer allowed Friday were homers, an extreme example of a recent tendency of seeing his mistakes fly over the fence. Why do his mistakes get hit so hard?

""I don't have an answer for you,"" he said as media crowded around him in the cramped visitor's clubhouse. "".?.?. Sometimes you got to let the sun come up before you can finally figure out what's actually going on.""

Scherzer said part of what makes this Cubs lineup so formidable is the way their left-handed hitters -- most notably Zobrist, who's actually a switch hitter, and Rizzo -- approach right-handed pitching. Zobrist has eight RBI in the first two games of this four-game series. The Nationals pursued Zobrist in the offseason, making him a four-year offer worth more than what the Cubs agreed to pay him. But drawn to his former manager Joe Maddon and the energetic aura of these Cubs, Zobrist spurned them.

The Nationals homered, too -- Anthony Rendon in the first and Wilson Ramos in the eighth -- but not nearly enough to keep up. The Nationals fell to 19-10 and 5-3 on this trip. The Cubs, meanwhile, improved to 22-6, the best start by a National League team since the 1977 Dodgers, for whom Nationals Manager Dusty Baker played left field.

""They're hot. They could be popping them up or hitting them on the ground. It ain't that easy,"" Baker said. "".?.?. You see home run derby. They don't hit every ball out of the ballpark. It's a matter of those guys are at a high concentration level, and they're beating on the ball right now.""

La Stella jumped on a first-pitch fastball for a two-run shot in the second. Rizzo drove a fastball high and deep to right field in the third, so high it was hard to tell whether it was fair or foul or over the right field foul pole. On close examination, it appeared to hit one of the small flags that hang there honoring Cubs greats.

Umpires initially ruled the ball a homer, a decision upheld after more than two minutes of review.

Scherzer wondered about the ruling, unsure of what should happen when a ball hits the flag. Baker said he had never seen a ball do that before. Regardless, the home run stood.

Zobrist followed Rizzo with another solo shot to make it 4-2, and two innings later added a three-run homer to give Chicago a seemingly comfortable 7-2 lead.

""That's just a really good club over there,"" Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy said. ""They don't swing at a lot of marginal pitches. .?.?. They're just doing damage on pitches that they want to hit. It's a difficult lineup to navigate, and they're playing really well.""

Zobrist likely would have played second base had he signed with the Nationals, and after he headed to Chicago instead, the Nationals signed Murphy. Zobrist's outburst over the past two days aside, Murphy has turned into a nice consolation prize.

Murphy led off the second with a double, his 11th in 28 games, and scored on a two-out single by Scherzer. He singled in the fourth, then ripped a shot by Rizzo at first in the sixth. Murphy began the day second in the majors in hitting and finished it 4 for 4, raising his average to .406.

""I'm looking for a pitch in my zone, trying to get my A swing off,"" Murphy said, repeating a phrase he has used to explain his approach and success throughout this spring, though it does not explain much at all. Ask the Cubs. Ask Scherzer. Explaining exactly why things are going well can be as difficult as explaining why they are not.",high,test

In April, Zuckerberg talked of ""fearful voices building walls"" - but Facebook insists that sponsorship of Republican convention is not an endorsement

Facebook will sponsor the Republican and Democratic national conventions this summer providing ""financial and other support"" - despite pressure from progressive organizations and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's own veiled criticisms of presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric.

""This support allows Facebook to facilitate an open dialogue among voters, candidates and elected officials during the conventions, just as it has during other critical moments in the US elections and in elections around the world,"" Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president of public policy, said in a statement.

Facebook maintains that its sponsorship of the GOP convention, which will reportedly include a ""lounge"", does not constitute an endorsement, but the announcement has angered a coalition of organizations that have launched campaigns urging technology companies and other corporations not to sponsor the party of Trump.

""Lifting up Donald Trump's fascist platform at the Republican National Convention is irresponsible and dangerous,"" said Murshed Zaheed, political director of the progressive activist network CREDO. ""It simply isn't possible for Facebook to financially support a Trump-led Republican convention without associating its brand with Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric.""

At Facebook's developer conference in April, Zuckerberg made guarded remarks about Trump describing ""fearful voices talking about building walls"".

""I hear them calling for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, for reducing trade, and in some cases, even for cutting access to the internet,"" he added.

Facebook employees have also had internal conversations about whether the powerful media platform has a ""responsibility ... to help prevent President Trump in 2017"", according to Gizmodo.

Zuckerberg's comments may have raised expectations that Facebook would balk at sponsoring an event that will mark Trump's official nomination as the Republican presidential candidate, but the CEO and his company have stymied liberal hopes in the past.

In 2013, Zuckerberg's political lobbying group Fwd.us paid for political advertisements supporting the Keystone XL pipeline, in a convoluted (and unsuccessful) play to win Republican votes for immigration reform.

Recently, Facebook has been under pressure from groups such as Color of Change to improve the diversity of its staff and to crack down on harassment and hate speech on its platform.

""When you put together those two things and add on the fact that they're choosing to sponsor a convention that is a coronation ball for a white nationalist who has said vile things about Latino people, Black people, Muslim people and women, it's troubling that Facebook would make a decision to host a lounge,"" said Arisha Hatch, managing director of campaigns for Color of Change.

Hatch said Facebook had convened a conference call with her and other organizations on Thursday to discuss the decision to host the convention, but did not back away from its position.

""Facebook, like Google, has a responsibility to support free speech, not the kind of chilling hate speech propagated by a Trump-led GOP convention,"" said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, who has worked with Facebook to address the problem of harassment of racial justice organizers on the platform.

""Facebook has expressed what I hoped was a genuine desire to ensure all its users were safe on its platform,"" she said, but its support of the convention ""discounts that work, and makes everyone, including Facebook users of color, less safe, less secure, and less supported online"".

Facebook is not the only tech company facing criticism for its sponsorship of the GOP convention.

On Thursday, CREDO released a video featuring clips of Trump's calling Mexicans rapists and calling for a total ban on Muslims entering the US and criticizing Google for its decision to sponsor the RNC.

The video will be advertised to more than 10,000 employees of Google, using micro-targeting - on Facebook.",high,test

According to a report released Friday by Harvard Business School, more U.S. companies are offering up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave to mothers who complete three months of work ahead of time. ""We strive to be accommodating to our employees as they start families, which is why we're granting paid time off to any expectant mothers who go on maternity leave having already completed the following 90 days' worth of their normal tasks and responsibilities,"" said Adam Ewert, CEO of Ewert Daniels Consulting, one of the companies mentioned in the report, adding that any women interested in taking advantage of the policy simply had to notify their manager and arrange for their absence by finishing their regular workload as well as all projects and assignments that would be expected in the ensuing financial quarter. ""We want to make sure our female employees don't have to choose between motherhood and their careers, and provided they finish three extra months of reports, send three extra months of emails, and make three extra months of presentations before they have their babies, this policy lets women take the time they need without setting themselves back at the workplace.""

Two boys were killed and another one was seriously wounded when a war-era bomb exploded in a field in northwestern Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province on Friday, provincial police chief Major General Men Ly said.

The three boys, aged between 12 and 15 years old, found the bomb when they tended cows in a rice paddy field near their village, he said.

""They had tried to break apart the bomb, causing the ordnance to explode,"" he told Xinhua, adding that police had not yet determined the type of the bomb.

""Two boys died instantly from the blast, as the third was in critical condition,"" he said.

Landmines and unexploded ordnance killed 18 Cambodian people and injured 93 others in 2015, according to a government's report.

The Southeast Asian country is one of the world's worst countries suffered from landmines and unexploded ordnance. An estimated 4 to 6 million landmines and other munitions were left over from three decades of war and internal conflicts that ended in 1998.

The country is seeking about 36 million U.S. dollars a year for the next decade to entirely get rid of all types of mines and explosive remnants of war.",high,test

186,"IMF dramatically cuts Brunei's GDP forecast for 2016

The International Monetary Fund expects Brunei's economy to contract by two percent this year, much lower than its October 2015 forecast of 3.2 percent expansion for 2016, local news daily Brunei Times reported Friday.

According to IMF's latest Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific report, Brunei's GDP forecast for the year continues a downward trend that started in 2013.

But the IMF expects the sultanate's economy to rebound in 2017, with GDP seen to expand by three percent. This figure is lower than the 3.8 percent growth projected in October 2015.

The IMF said Brunei's economy shrunk only by 0.2 percent in 2015, in comparison to a forecast contraction of 1.2 percent that was made last year.

The Washington-based institution said ASEAN's economic growth will remain uneven, reflecting the member countries disparate stages of development.

For most major ASEAN economies, the turning of the credit and housing cycles and the increase in benchmark lending rates and spreads are expected to have an impact on domestic demand. Recent declines in the equity markets have likewise dented sentiment.

Headwinds from the weak global recovery, a broader tightening of financial conditions and high debt are also expected to slow down growth.",high,test
187,"Christ Does Soft Return To Gauge Interest

Descending from on high to gather valuable data on His followers' preferences, Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, was said to be conducting a soft return this week in hopes of gauging interest in His Second Coming.

Christ reportedly rolled out a test version of His return in select cities -- including Topeka, KS, Fort Wayne, IN, and a handful of other locations throughout Christendom -- as part of a controlled study to determine who among His flock might look favorably upon a miraculous reappearance and thousand-year reign of their Lord and Savior.

""These cities offer good cross-sections of the faithful, so we'll be able to closely evaluate the reaction among the various demographics we're trying to appeal to,"" said Christ, explaining that representative populations of believers were chosen to partake in the soft return in order to more accurately predict how the various planned elements of the Last Judgment would be received in a real-world setting. ""We've already seen some interesting results that will help us to fine-tune this thing before we go wide with it.""

He added, ""For example, the 18-to-34-year-old population in Topeka didn't respond well to the booming voice of an archangel and the Trumpet of God announcing my return, so that's definitely something we'll want to tweak.""

According to sources, focus groups of local Christians have been assembled in the designated cities and asked to rate as positive, negative, or neutral their response to certain details of the Second Coming, such as an ominous darkening of the horizon, flashing white-hot streaks of lightning filling the sky, and a great chasm opening in the heavens as the blindingly bright figure of Christ descends to earth.

The Only Begotten Son of God admitted to reporters that most of those who witnessed the soft return didn't like the ""dark, scary stuff"" much at all and that He would have to see what could be done to ""lighten things up here and there."" However, Christ said, most people responded positively to the moment when Satan, Prince of Darkness, was bound in chains and thrown into a bottomless pit, and the subset of believers who were raptured seemed very pleased with the experience.

Reports confirmed that all of the study's participants had ascended into heaven and been given seats at the right hand of the Father in exchange for their time, energy, and helpful suggestions.

""At this stage, we're just trying to get as much feedback as possible so we can work out all the kinks before I actually come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,"" said Christ, adding that while He thought His followers would be excited to see their deceased loved ones again, many were in fact completely terrified when He raised the dead from their graves. ""We definitely need to work on the optics of our presentation. People were losing interest after the first two or three of the seven seals were opened, and that's a problem.""

Christ indicated He would have to consult further with His team before deciding if the time was right to roll out His return on a global scale.

""We only have one chance to pull this off, so we need to nail down every detail,"" He said. ""Some of this stuff was planned 2,000 years ago, and I'm just not sure it's going to work in the present day and age. The whole part about the Antichrist forging a seven-year covenant with Israel, for example, really seems a bit outdated and might have to be scrapped altogether.""

""And if interest in me banishing all evil from the face of the earth just isn't high enough right now, we should go back to the drawing board and maybe do some more trial runs in another millennium or so,"" Christ added.",low,test
188,"Spotlight: DPRK ruling party's congress opens, consolidating core leadership

The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), the ruling party of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Friday opened its 7th Congress -- the first WPK congress in 36 years and the first under the leadership of Kim Jong Un.

Considered the most significant political event for the country in 2016, the congress is not only a decision-making occasion when the ruling party mulls new state and economic policies and makes medium- and long-term development plans, but is also a chance for the DPRK to consolidate its core leadership.

The congress was reportedly to begin at 9 a.m. local time (0030 GMT) at the April 25 Cultural House in central Pyongyang. The culture house, which is the main site for the congress, was named after the founding date of the Korean People's Army.

Attending the congress are about 3,000 party representatives from across the country. Mass parades and torch processions, which tens of thousands of people have been practicing for days or even months, will take place during or after the congress.

Throngs of local people jammed the Kim Il Sung Square with bouquets held in hands, still rehearsing for the extravaganza.

More than 100 foreign journalists were invited to take photographs and videos outside the venue and were permitted to interview Pyongyang residents around, but were not allowed to enter the meeting hall.

In late Friday evening, the Korean Central Television broadcast an edited recorded video of the opening ceremony, at which Kim made an opening address.

Yoon Hae Ryoong, a senior student majoring in mechanics from Kim Il Sung University, told Xinhua that he sees the 7th congress as a historic watershed in the revolutionary cause of the DPRK.

He said that as a young college student, he was lucky to take part in the parade and torch march to help the congress bear more fruits.

He said the concurrent development of nuclear weapons and national economy is a long-term strategy, rather than a makeshift to deal with ""U.S. imperialists.""

The year 2016 is the third year since Kim initiated the ""Line of Byungjin (Line of Parallel Development)"" to simultaneously push forward economic growth and bolster nuclear capability at a plenary meeting of the party's Central Committee in March 2013.

Analysts say the 7th congress may focus on further consolidating the policy of developing nuclear weapons and national economy at the same time and emphasize the DPRK's status as a nuclear state.

On Thursday, the foreign journalists were shown around a revolutionary museum built inside the DPRK's first-ever weapons factory. The establishment of the weapons factory marked the start of the country's munitions industry with its independent strength and technology.

On Dec. 9, 2015, when the country's top leader Kim Jong Un visited the revolutionary relics, he announced for the first time that the DPRK is able to produce hydrogen bombs.

In the afternoon of the opening day of the congress, journalists were invited to visit the Pyongyang March 26 Cable Factory under the arrangement of the DPRK side.

The factory's general manager Kim Sok Nam told the journalists that despite the latest round of U.N. sanctions, the workers are working even harder to echo the party's call for a 70-day campaign right ahead of the party congress and the output has been doubled.

""We are now creating the Mallima (a horse that runs 10,000 miles a day) Speed in production,"" he said.

On Saturday, the journalists are invited to tour around Pyongyang Metro and take the modern subway train the DPRK claims made by itself. They will also visit the Mirae Scientists Street, a compound built for scientists and educators at the initiative of Kim Jong Un and completed on the occasion of the 70th founding anniversary of the party last year.

Pyongyang announced in October 2015 that the 7th WPK congress will be convened in early May. The 6th congress was held in 1980.

It is expected to have a reshuffle of senior party and state officials, including the members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, and introduce new policies in terms of economic development, inter-Korean relations, and even revise the Party Constitution.",high,test
189,"Finding Neverland to close on Broadway, Weinstein confirms

The musical adaption of Finding Neverland is to close on Broadway, producer Harvey Weinstein has confirmed.

The show will be performed in New York for the final time in August, 18 months after it opened.

A national tour followed by a run in London's West End will still go ahead as planned.

Weinstein also announced that a film version of the stage musical will be produced.

Finding Neverland originally started life as a non-musical film starring Johnny Depp. It was released in 2004 by Miramax, the company co-founded by Weinstein.

The musical version received its world premiere in Leicester in 2012 before transferring to Broadway last March.

The production received lukewarm reviews from critics, but had strong box office sales when it first opened.

Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer led the show's original Broadway cast.

The New York stage production has grossed $54m to date, but has not yet recouped its investors' money.

""We believe the tour will help us recoup and London will be the profits,"" Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter.

""Night after night the audiences' love for the show has been so inspiring.""

""Neverland will be beginning its around-the-world tour starting in the US in October, then London in Spring of 2017 and Asia in 2018.""

Weinstein's previous investments on Broadway include The Producers, August: Osage County and Billy Elliot, but Finding Neverland was his first as lead producer.

He has already announced that his next Broadway venture will be a transfer of Singin' in the Rain.

As a film producer, Weinstein's credits include Shakespeare In Love, The Artist, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech.",high,test
190,"French police hit back at 'anti-cop hatred' after protest violence

Unions call for day of action after 300 officers injured and others accused of misconduct in clashes with demonstrators

French police are to take to the streets in a national protest against ""anti-cop hatred"" this month, after clashes with demonstrators at rallies against labour reforms sparked accusations of police violence and several investigations into alleged misconduct.

The Alliance police union, backed by several other groups representing officers, called for demonstrations on 18 May, saying it was ""outraged by the irresponsible and relentless drive to make out that police officers are savage brutes who blindly beat youths"".

Since protests began two months ago against Fran?ois Hollande's contested labour reforms, tension between police and demonstrators has been growing. The Nuit Debout (Up All Night) protest movement has occupied city squares across France, and there have been clashes at heavily policed rallies.

More than 1,000 people have been arrested and more than 300 police and gendarmes have been injured during the demonstrations, according to the French authorities. On one protest day last week, police fired teargas and masked youths threw bottles and cobblestones, leaving 24 police injured, three of them seriously, according to the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve.

The government has blamed an ""irresponsible minority"" of troublemakers on the fringes of the demonstrations for attacking police. But demonstrators and unions have accused the police of poor tactics and using disproportionate force and violence. Videos and photographs have been circulated of alleged police brutality. ""Film a cop, save lives"" read graffiti in Paris during May Day demonstrations last weekend.

One police officer is facing a criminal trial after he was apparently filmed punching a restrained high-school pupil on the margins of a school demonstration in March. Cazeneuve has said he was shocked by the case.

Another investigation was launched after footage showed a masked, plainclothes officer beating pupils at the same high-school demonstration. A further investigation is under way after a student protester in Rennes last month lost an eye when riot police allegedly opened fire with ""flash-ball"" weapons to control a crowd.

The leftwing CGT trade union has issued two flyers - one in April and one this week - warning against police violence. The first, picturing mock blood on the ground, said: ""The police should protect its citizens, not beat them."" The most recent featured mock blood under riot police boots, and said: ""Stop the Repression."" Police unions roundly criticised the images.

Trade unions, student groups and some voices on the left have questioned the Socialist government's policing tactics. Launching a police recruitment drive this week, Cazeneuve told France Inter radio he was angry that some were saying there was ""a strategy of violence orchestrated by the state, when the state is there to protect"".

At demonstrations against the labour reform bill outside parliament this week, protesters chanted what has now become a regular slogan: ""Everyone hates the police."" The tension is in stark contrast to the public show of support for police after terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher grocery store last year, in which three officers were killed.

Michel Cadot, the police prefect in Paris, told RTL radio this week that he believed police had shown ""very great restraint"" during recent demonstrations. He said he felt it was the police who had been ""victims of unmeasurable violence"".

He added: ""If, here and there, there has been behaviour disproportionate to the responsible use of force, that will be the subject of an investigation and if there has been wrongdoing, there must be sanctions.""

This year the French NGO Acat (Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture) issued a report on 89 cases of alleged police use of violence between 2005 and 2015, and warned of a lack of transparency. An investigation is ongoing into the high-profile case of R?mi Fraisse, an environmental activist killed by a police grenade in 2014.

Separately, an investigation has been opened by France's citizens' rights watchdog after a video went viral this week showing a black man on the ground with his prosthetic legs removed, allegedly after a police check at Paris's Gare de Lyon station. Police told AFP the man had been urinating on the platform and that it was a routine check.

Police stop-and-frisk procedures have also been in the spotlight after an appeal court ruled last year that officers had carried out unjustified identity checks on five men from ethnic minorities, and ordered the government to pay damages.

Racial profiling has long been a fraught issue in France, contributing to tension and urban rioting on housing estates.

Hollande, before his election as president in 2012, acknowledged that racial profiling in police checks was a problem and made a campaign promise to introduce a form of written receipt for all checks, but there has been no reform.",high,test
191,"Facebook loses first round in suit over storing biometric data

Facebook Inc lost the first round in a court fight against some of its users who sued the social networking company, alleging it ""unlawfully"" collected and stored users' biometric data derived from their faces in photographs.

The judge presiding over the case in a California federal court on Thursday turned down Facebook's motion seeking dismissal of the suit.

Facebook filed the motion arguing that the users could not file a complaint under Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) as they had agreed in their user agreement that California law would govern their disputes with the company, and that BIPA does not apply to ""tag suggestions.""

The court found that Illinois law applies and that the plaintiffs have stated a claim under BIPA.

The complainants had alleged that Facebook's face recognition feature that suggests ""tags"" on photos unlawfully collected and stored biometric data, in violation of the Illinois BIPA.

192,"Baseball Dopers' New Drug Is an Old One Used by East Germany

The list of players who have been suspended by Major League Baseball since 2005 for taking banned substances is 42 pages long, and it includes a passel of pharmacological quick fixes like boldenone, clenbuterol, formestane and stanozolol.

But recently, three players -- the major leaguers Daniel Stumpf of the Phillies and Chris Colabello of the Blue Jays and the minor leaguer Kameron Loe -- were suspended for taking Turinabol, an anabolic steroid straight out of a doping time machine.

The drug, whose chemical compound is dehydrochlormethyltestosterone, was widely used by athletes in East Germany. Developed in the 1960s by Jenapharm, an East German drug company, Turinabol became a foundation of the East German sports machine that rivaled the United States and the Soviet Union for medal supremacy at the Winter and Summer Olympics in the 1970s and 1980s.

But after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Turinabol largely disappeared, and antidoping experts do not know any major pharmaceutical company that produces the drug.

Yet athletes have found a way to get their hands on the drug, which can help muscles retain protein to build or repair them, and more player suspensions for the drug may be announced in the coming weeks, according to a person with knowledge of baseball's antidoping program.

Baseball, though, has only just started to catch players using Turinabol. Officials monitoring wrestling, weight lifting and other sports have been catching athletes using the drug in recent years. Last year, 11 of the 17 athletes suspended at the world weight lifting championships in Houston were found to have taken Turinabol, and they came from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Greece, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Russia.

""It is a relative epidemic, and this is not only North America,"" said Dr. Christiane Ayotte, the director of the Montreal Doping Control Laboratory. ""It might have started in the former Eastern bloc countries.""

Antidoping experts believe unscrupulous chemists in the United States may be creating the drug or, more likely, it is being imported. Dr. Don Catlin, an antidoping pioneer in the United States who ran the drug testing lab at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, said Turinabol was easily obtainable online. He added that it was contained as a labeled ingredient in at least one supplement that can be bought off-the-shelf. It is also possible that the steroid is contained as an unlabeled product in a supplement, he said.

""I suspect somebody got a big supply of it somewhere and has been distributing it among friends and neighbors,"" Catlin said. ""One guy gets it and feels it's working and tells all his buddies. Next thing you know, you've got a miniepidemic.""

That Turinabol has shown up in supplements sold in America means some athletes may have unwittingly taken the drug. To be safe, Canadian authorities have warned their Olympic athletes to stay away from supplements sold in the United States, said Dr. Bob McCormack, the chief medical officer of the Canadian Olympic team.

""A high percentage of the raw materials for supplements come from China, where there is poor quality control, and there is a powerful lobby in the U.S. to combat oversight, so we tell athletes in Canada not to take U.S. supplements,"" he said.

Although Turinabol proved infamously effective as an East German steroid, Catlin said, it does not clear the body quickly and is easily detectable. For years, it did not appear to be in widespread international use. An average of four to six positive tests were recorded annually by the 35 labs of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Catlin said. Then the number spiked to 73 in 2013, before lowering again to 17 in 2014 and 14 in 2015, he said, citing WADA statistics.

""These things come and go,"" Catlin said. But he added, ""To think just because it's old means you can't detect it is nonsense.""

In fact, one reason for the spike in suspensions is, like a cat-and-mouse game, antidoping authorities have found more sophisticated ways of testing for the drug. In 2012, Tim Sobolevsky and Grigory Rodchenkov published a paper in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology that outlined a more effective test for Turinabol.

Since then, antidoping groups and sports leagues have updated their tests to better detect the drug. Turinabol had been on Major League Baseball's banned list for years, but the league updated its testing techniques to look for the drug in 2014 as part of an annual review of its drug testing protocol.

Ayotte, the director of the Montreal Doping Control Laboratory, said the number of positive tests for Turinabol will start to drop as athletes realize that leagues and associations are doing a better job of looking for the drug.

But it will take time for word to get around. The baseball players recently caught using Turinabol may not have been aware of its East German provenance, Catlin said, or they didn't care. ""The side effects are horrendous, particularly to women,"" he said. ""But male baseball players probably don't give a damn.""

Few players, if any, may know that the state-sponsored doping system in East Germany was known by the euphemism Supporting Means, and involved as many as 10,000 athletes. Oral-Turinabol was often given to unsuspecting athletes, including teenagers and children, who were told that the blue pills were vitamins.

A number of former East German athletes have said that they developed chronic health problems, believed to be related to taking massive amounts of Turinabol. In 2006, Jenapharm agreed to pay 184 former East German athletes about $12,000 each, while the German Olympic Committee agreed to pay 170 athletes the same amount.

Perhaps the most extreme case involving Turinabol use was that of Heidi Krieger, who won the women's shot put at the 1986 European track and field championships. In a 2004 interview with The New York Times, Krieger said that the taking of steroids created virile features and heightened confusion about her already uncertain gender identity. In 1997, Krieger underwent sexual-reassignment surgery and is now known as Andreas Krieger.

The fact that the drug is now so easily detected is why Victor Conte, who ran the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative lab in Northern California that figured into a widespread doping scandal more than a decade ago, wrote on his Twitter account that the knowing use of Turinabol was ""dumber than dumb.""

Steven Ungerleider, the author of ""Faust's Gold,"" a book about the East German doping system, said the emergence of Turinabol in baseball was ""a little odd.""

""There's a zillion other ways more sophisticated"" to use banned substances and avoid detection, said Ungerleider, a sports psychologist in Eugene, Ore. ""Why would anyone go back to using that? But people do crazy things.""",high,test

The Hollywood stars have made an effort to take trips as a family since their split

They split after ten years last summer but a reconciliation could be on the cards for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner after they were reportedly spotted kissing in a hotel bar in Paris.

The famous pair have been spotted enjoying a family holiday in Paris with their children.

According to the Mail Online, an onlooker the pair were seen getting cosy in the courtyard bar of their luxury hotel.

Since parting ways last June, the Hollywood stars have remained close and have been papped on numerous family outings together since then.

They were even rumoured to be sharing the same house for months after their split in order to keep things as normal as possible for their children.

Ben, 43, and Jennifer, 44, are parents to Violet, ten, Seraphina, seven, and Samuel, four.

Ben is currently filming his upcoming flick, Justice League in London. The superhero movie is slated for release in November 2017.

Jen has flown the children over on a number of occasions and as well as visiting London they have been using the English capital as a base to explore Europe.

Earlier this week, a source told People that the couple were ""enjoying showing the kids London"".

They recently visited the Harry Potter studio tour at Warner Bros Studios Leavesden in Hertfordshire.

On their recent trip to Paris, they were spotted bringing their three young children or some ice-cream in the warm weather.

The couple brought their brood to the Amorino ice cream parlous for some yummy treats. They didn't use their star power to skip the queue and instead were spotted waiting patiently for their turn.

Samuel was seen sitting on the ground while he waited for his ice cream cone.

Ben and Jennifer, who were joined by their children's nanny, happily chatted to fans and other tourists.

Afterwards, Ben was seen carrying Seraphina on his shoulders and they later spent some time playing the park.

Later that evening onlookers said they saw the couple kissing in the courtyard bar of their luxury hotel.

However, it remains to be seen if the pair will reunite as Jennifer candidly spoke to Vanity Fair in February about how hard the split was.

She said: ""I didn't marry the big fat movie star; I married him. And I would go back and remake that decision.

""I ran down the beach to him, and I would again. You can't have these three babies and so much of what we had. He's the love of my life.

""He's the most brilliant person in any room, the most charismatic, the most generous. He's just a complicated guy. I always say, ""When his sun shines on you, you feel it.""

""But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it's cold. He can cast quite a shadow.""

It had been widely reported that Ben had cheated on her with their nanny Christine Ouzounian but Jen denied it happened while they were still together.

She said: ""We had been separated for months before I ever heard about the nanny.

""She had nothing to do with our decision to divorce. She was not a part of the equation. Bad judgement? Yes.""",uncertain,test

Fashion designer Rachel has often been rumoured to be the woman in the middle of the infamous elevator fight between Bey's sister Solange and Jay Z

Rachel Roy is one of a number of women at the centre of the ""Becky"" infidelity storm.

Fans were quick to speculate that the fashion designer could be the one Beyonce was singing about on new track Sorry, and she's also believed to be the reason behind Solange attacking Jay Z in a lift back in 2014.

But the truth could finally come out as it's now been claimed her private emails could be made public.

The fashion designer, who was previously married to Jay Z's former business partner Damon Dash, has reportedly told friends that personal information on her computer has been ""stolen"".

A source told the newspaper: ""Rachel has confided to friends about the stolen emails. She has no idea how they've been swiped but is aware how much harm they can cause.

""From a personal level, she wanted to distance herself from the furore after initially playing up to the link as Jay Z's rumoured other woman.

""But now she fears the spotlight will be well and truly back on her, Jay Z and Beyonce if these conversations end up online.""

Rachel didn't do herself any favours when she appeared to hint that she was ""Becky with the good hair"" shortly after Beyonce debuted Lemonade.

195,"Zimbabwe to print local 'US dollar' to ease severe cash crunch

Currency shortage prompts national reserve to introduce new notes, currently in the 'design stage'

Zimbabweans are forming long queues outside banks amid a cash shortage that has prompted the government to announce plans to print a local version of the US dollar and to limit withdrawals.

The government adopted US and South African currencies in 2009 after hyperinflation rendered the national currency unusable as the economy collapsed.

A recent shortage of foreign notes led Reserve Bank Governor John Mangudya to unveil a raft of radical measures on Wednesday, including limiting withdrawals to $1,000 or 20,000 South African rand per day.

Mangudya said that the central bank would also print its own dollar-equivalent bond notes - ""which are currently at the design stage"" - to ease the cash crunch.

Mangudya denied the new banknotes were a step towards re-introducing the tarnished Zimbabwe dollar, but the plan was still criticised by some experts.

""This is extremely damaging to the interests of everyone and very dangerous to the economy,"" independent economist John Robertson said in Harare.

""It won't be long before this becomes another inflation story. People will refuse to be paid their wages in bond notes.

""Shops will not accept them as they cannot be used to restock [from abroad]. I am hoping that the government can be talked out of it.""

Bond coins were introduced in Zimbabwe in 2014 to tackle the problem of small change.

The new notes in denominations of $2, $5, $10 and $20 will play a similar role, acting as tokens.

They will be backed by a $200-million support facility provided by Afreximbank (Africa Export-Import Bank), the government said.

""This does not signal the reintroduction of the Zimbabwe currency,"" Mangudya said. ""The fundamentals are not yet right for its comeback. This is just a measure to curb illicit flows out of the country.""

Economists blame the cash shortage on a trade deficit which saw the country's import bills standing at $490m in the first quarter against $167m in exports.

Apart from limits on withdrawals, the amount of cash that can be taken out of the country per trip has been cut from $5,000 to $1,000.

In the queues outside the banks, tempers were running high.

""I am supposed to be at work but here I am queueing since yesterday,"" said Monique Fore, 39, a bursar at a school in Harare. ""It's becoming embarrassing explaining to my landlord that I can't withdraw money to pay rent.""

In some cases, banks have limited the amount that can be taken out to $200 - well below the maximum set by the government.

Shadreck Mafukeni, a 57-year-old carpenter working for a furniture manufacturer, said his salary had been deposited in the bank on Tuesday but he had been unable to withdraw any money.

""I need to pay rent, my children's school fees and I also need to repay debts to several people I owe money.

""I have used the little money I had at home on the bus fare. If I don't get money today, I will walk back home.""

Zimbabwe once removed 12 zeros from its battered currency at the height of hyper-inflation in 2009 when the largest note was the $100 trillion denomination.

The seizure of white-owned farms starting in 2000 left the agricultural sector in ruin, and triggered a sharp economic slowdown, with mass unemployment, emigration and many business closures.

President Robert Mugabe, 92, has ruled the country, which relies on imports for even basic commodities, since independence in 1980.",high,test
196,"In Afghanistan, al-Qaeda is working more closely with the Taliban, Pentagon says

What remains of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is now working more closely with the Taliban, a spokesman for the U.S. led-mission there told reporters Thursday. If true, the renewed cooperation between the two groups marks another chapter in a relationship that has ebbed and flowed since 2001.

According to U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, al-Qaeda is providing more ""capabilities and skills"" to the 30,000 strong insurgent group than they have in the past.

Last year, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, announced his support for the Taliban's new head, Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour.

""Since that time, we have seen more interaction. We have seen them working more together,"" Cleveland said.

Mansour's ascension to power was tumultuous, as the insurgent group was rocked when it was discovered that its senior leadership had been hiding the death of Mullah Omar, the Taliban's shadowy leader, for more than two years.

Cleveland did not specify what type of skills al-Qaeda is providing to the Taliban; in the past, the terror group has provided bomb-makers and suicide bombers to its allies. According to Cleveland, there are roughly 300 al-Qaeda fighters still in Afghanistan spread out across a number of provinces such as Kunar, Kandahar and Ghazni.

""Although [al-Qaeda] have been significantly diminished, they do have the ability to regenerate very quickly, and they still do have the ability to pose a threat,"" Cleveland said.

Al-Qaeda in the months before 9/11 had roughly 3,000 fighters loyal to its then-leader, Osama bin Laden. In the 15 years since the terror attacks, the United States has systematically gone after the group and its various global offshoots, killing its leaders with drone strikes and Special Operations raids.

The United States has roughly 10,000 troops still in Afghanistan providing advice and assistance to the embattled Afghan security forces. While the United States announced an official end to its combat role there in 2014, U.S. and allied Special Operations forces often accompany their Afghan counterparts on missions against the Taliban. In addition to the United States' advisory role, known as Resolute Support, U.S. forces also run a counter-terrorism campaign that specifically goes after al-Qaeda as well as the Islamic State's franchise based out of Nangarhar Province in the east of the country.

According to Cleveland, there are roughly 1,500 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, a number, he believes, that has been whittled down because of U.S. airstrikes. Since January  the United States has conducted roughly 120 airstrikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan, the majority of which were aimed at the Islamic State. Under current rules of engagement, U.S. aircraft can only strike the Taliban in situations that involve the defense of U.S. forces or if both U.S. and Afghan troops are directly threatened.

Gen. John F. Campbell, the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, recommended resuming offensive airstrikes against the Taliban prior to the end of his tenure earlier this year. His replacement, Gen. John W. ""Mick"" Nicholson Jr. is in the midst of a 90-day assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, and it is unclear if he will make a similar recommendation to the president. He is expected to report this month.

The Taliban made significant gains in 2015, and at one point took control of the northern city of Kunduz before being pushed out by Afghan and U.S. forces supported by airstrikes. The offensive marked the first time the Taliban had control of an urban area since the group was first routed in 2001.

The Taliban controls large swaths of rural territory, including in its birthplace of Helmand Province. According to Cleveland, fighting around Helmand has been especially light this past month as the Taliban has been concentrated on the annual harvest. The Afghan Army's embattled 215th Corps has lost a number of villages in Helmand in recent months, and the funds acquired from the recent harvest will likely allow the Taliban to go on the offensive.

""We think that'll be the next big Taliban push,"" Cleveland said. ""We think it will come in Helmand.""",high,test
197,"Spain reports first case of Zika-related birth defect

The first case of microcephaly in the fetus of a woman infected by the Zika virus has been detected in Spain, it has been confirmed by health authorities in the Catalan region of Spain.

The woman is reported to be 20 weeks pregnant and was infected with the virus during a trip to Latin America. The Spanish media reports that she intends to continue with her pregnancy.

The Zika Virus is thought to be responsible for causing microcephaly, which means the brain fails to develop properly, in some fetuses carried by infected women.

The virus has so far been detected in 13 pregnant women in Spain, but this is the first malformation that authorities have discovered.

The Catalan Health Authority has highlighted the importance of informing pregnant women of the possible risks of travelling to areas where the Zika virus can spread, especially the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa.

The Spanish Ministry for Health, Social Services and Equality informs on its official website a total of 105 cases of the Zika virus have been detected in Spain to date, highlighting that in every case the virus was contracted when the victim was travelling abroad and that so far there have been no cases of anyone being infected within Spain.",high,test
198,"Oil up on Canada wildfire, dollar; big weekly loss for Brent

Oil prices edged up on Friday, supported by an early dip in the dollar and a wildfire that has shrunk Canadian oil sands crude output by a third, but Brent still ended with its sharpest weekly drop in four months as investors cashed out of April's big rally.

Reports of a militant attack on a Chevron platform in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta region and a drop in the number of U.S. oil drilling rigs also helped lift prices on the day.

The dollar, which has a huge impact on greenback-denominated commodities such as oil, was down most of the day before recovering in late trade. The dollar dipped after the U.S. government reported that the economy added the fewest number of jobs in seven months in April, raising doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year.

Brent crude futures settled up 36 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $45.37 a barrel.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures finished up 53 cents, or about 0.8 percent too, at $44.66.

For the week, Brent slid 6 percent for its biggest weekly decline since January. WTI fell 3 percent. The drops came after profit-taking by investors early in the week on April's gain of 20 percent or more in the two crude benchmarks.

""The global surplus still exists and there is still a possibility that oil prices could retrace further,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute.

""However, the market is trading more and more in sync with the forward-looking or perception view, with the current bearish fundamentals mostly priced into the market.""

At least 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Canada's crude production capacity remained offline as the wildfires ravaged the oil town of Fort McMurray in Alberta and forced evacuation of workers and precautionary production cuts or shutdowns at about a dozen major facilities.

While most of the oil sands are to the north of the city, CNOOC Nexen's Long Lake facility and Athabasca Oil's Hangingstone project are south of Fort McMurray and were in danger, according to emergency officials. Both facilities have been evacuated.

The U.S. oil rig count, compiled by oilfield services provider Baker Hughes fell by four this week, extending a decline to a seventh week and the lowest level since October 2009.

Some analysts said oil output in the Americas is declining so fast that it looks like the region alone could resolve the global oversupply.

""Unplanned oil supply disruptions have been a key element so far this year that have contributed to a tighter oil market than was otherwise expected,"" said analyst Guy Baber of Simmons & Co.",high,test

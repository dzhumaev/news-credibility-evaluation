Madonna is not planning on meeting the mother of Jesus. At least not yet.

Traveling to Brazil this week with 23 year-old boyfriend Jesus Luz, Madonna, 51, squashed a report that she'll spend some time with Cristiane Regina da Silva, Luz's mom,  who is 14 years younger than Madonna.

""I am going there strictly for fundraising and humanitarian purposes,"" she told the New York Post. That includes a meeting with the governor of Rio de Janeiro and sponsorship of a documentary about impoverished local children.

This follows Tuesday's claims by the UK's Daily Mail that Madonna was ""slightly on edge"" about meeting her boyfriend's 37 year-old mother, a hairdresser who had Jesus as a teen and felt ""uncomfortable"" about his relationship.

The pop star, 51, was in the African nation Malawi with her four children at the end of October for similar charity efforts. Visiting the orphanage where she found son David, 4, Madonna encountered a young orphan who said, ""You are our god . . . Where could we have been without you?""

She and the 23 year-old Luz, a model and aspiring DJ, have been dating since February 2009.",uncertain,training

The pageant world has been rocked by yet another scandal! 

Former Miss Brazil Taiza Thomsen last spoke to her family in September, saying she was in London. After not hearing from the 24-year-old stunner for months, family members contacted authorities to look into her whereabouts. Brazilian police began searching for Thomsen in January, and suggested that human trafficking may have played a role in her inexplicable disappearance! 

Luckily, that was not the case. Earlier this week, Brazilian officials revealed that runway runaway Thomsen called them and said, ""...she was doing well in London and that she didn't want to be found, not even by her parents."" Authorities don't intend to investigate further -- and closed the case.

Thomsen, who competed in Donald Trump's 2003 Miss Universe pageant, is the latest beauty queen to make ugly headlines on the heels of Mess USA Tara Conner's rehab stint.

5,"Brazil may lose World Cup spot

Bruno Cazarine Constantino. Remember the name as he may become as infamous as Jean-Marc Bosman.

Cazarine, you see, is the reason Brazil could be banned from playing in next summer's World Cup finals.

That's right, Brazil, the world's favourite football team, could be kicked out of South Africa 2010.

A tournament without them may be unthinkable but a legal case brought against the Brazilian FA (CBF) by one of the smallest clubs under its jurisdiction is threatening exactly that.

And at the centre of the whole affair is the unlikely figure of Cazarine, 26, who could be about to become public enemy No 1.

Cazarine is an unlikely villain in such a major drama, especially one of the scale which has unfolded in Brazil in the past two months.

He's a journeyman player - a very average midfielder who has bounced around nine clubs in the last six years.

It's his last three, however, which have put FIFA at odds with the CBF and could yet carry the ultimate sanction for the Brazil national team.

The row revolves around the outcome of the Brazilian Serie B - and the final placing of two teams.

Guarani, for whom Cazarine plays, came second and were promoted, while Portuguesa finished fifth, meaning they missed going up by one place.

Portuguesa then filed an official complaint against Guarani to the CBF on the basis that Cazarine has played for three different clubs in the same season.

In doing so, he was in clear violation of the FIFA Players' Status rules - Article 5, Paragraph 3.

Both Guarani and the CBF brushed off the protest as insignificant and cited exceptional circumstances.

The player left Brazil's AC Chapecoense on May 10 this year to sign for South Korea's Gyeongnam FC, where he played until joining Guarani on July 13.

Guarani argued he was exempt because FIFA rules allow a player to have three clubs in a season if one club's championship competition is not on the same calendar as his new club.

The excuse was flimsy at best as the K League ran from March to December, while Brazil's season ran from May to December.

Yet, amazingly, the CBF still accepted this explanation.

Portuguesa appointed the highly-respected legal team to take the case to FIFA.

SunSport has acquired copies of the documents sent on Portuguesa's behalf to FIFA, citing the CBF and Guarani's transgression.

We also have the acknowledgement of the citation by FIFA's legal director Marco Villiger and the deputy head of the Players' Status Committee, Daniel Pose.

A meeting is scheduled for January 5. FIFA will decide how the case should proceed.

Paulo Teixeira, who is leading Portuguesa's case, also has proof that the CBF failed in their responsibility as the association in charge of the clubs to punish Guarani.

In doing so, what should have been a local spat between clubs the size of Grimsby and Rotherham has become an issue which could rock soccer to its very core.

Since the complaint is now very much against the CBF as well as Guarani and has been passed to FIFA, it's the world body which must now act by applying its own law.

And that law states that any member association which fails to punish correctly a club which breaks FIFA rules will have its national team suspended from playing in the next official tournament.

Now the cynical among you (me included) will no doubt argue there's no way Sepp Blatter and Co will allow the greatest show on earth to go on without its biggest star.

Surely they'll find some loophole to ensure Brazil take their place in the Group of Death alongside Portugal, Ivory Coast and North Korea.

Maybe. But with a presidential election at FIFA in which Blatter is hoping to win a fourth term, can anyone be seen to so blatantly flout their own rules?

Make no mistake, Portuguesa mean business and will not go away quietly.

Of course it would be a shame for football fans if Brazil were absent.

Yet one team's loss is normally another's gain, and should FIFA replace Brazil, at least they have a country with a strong claim to be there next summer.

Boxing legend Arturo Gatti has been found dead in a hotel room in Brazil at the age of 37.

Initial reports indicate the death may not have been due to natural causes with the former world champion appearing to have suffered injuries to his head and neck.

Police investigator Edilson Alves said: ""It is still too early to say anything concrete, although it is all very strange.""

Gatti, who was born in Italy, had arrived at the seaside resort of Porto de Galinhas with his wife and one-year-old son on Friday.

He held the IBF super-featherwight and WBC light-welterweight titles and was involved in a famous trilogy with 'Irish' Micky Ward, winning the last two contests on points.

Gatti faced Floyd Mayweather Jnr in June 2005 but it quickly became clear he was past his best and Money claimed the WBC crown courtesy of a sixth-round stoppage.

He retired in 2007 with a record of 40 wins - 31 by knockout - and nine losses.

Kathy Duva, of Gatti's promoters Main Events, said: ""His entire boxing career he fought with us, we've known him since he was 17.

""He just captured the imagination of so many people.

""He had no idea what an icon he was or how much he meant to people.""",uncertain,test
8,"Exclusive: Mum of Brazil suitcase girl vows revenge

The shattered mum of dismembered Brazil suitcase girl Cara Burke yesterday vowed: ""I will kill the monster who did this.""

Anne-Marie Burke, 53, told how her 17-year-old daughter sent a text message just two weeks ago begging: ""Please mum, I want to come home.""

Cara was stabbed in the heart with a kitchen knife. Her torso was found in a suitcase dumped on a riverbank.

Boyfriend Mohammed Dali Carvalho dos Santos, 20, has been charged with murder after allegedly admitting killing Cara after a row on Saturday.

Dos Santos, whose parents live in London, gave an interview to local newspaper Hoje Noticia boasting that he felt ""nothing"" while he was cutting up her body. He described it: ""Just like cutting beef, except for the bleeding"".

Anne-Marie said last night: ""I'll kill the remorseless b*****d who killed my baby. I'll never recover from this. My baby is in bits, they can't even find her. I need her back, I just want to get my baby back where she belongs.

""That monster has taken my girl. He took her life and I want his. She wasn't an angel but she didn't deserve that.

""I saw him on the TV and he showed no remorse. He even said he had no regrets. That was the final insult for me. He took my daughter and he doesn't even care.""

Brazilian police revealed that Dos Santos - who may have had an accomplice to help him dispose of the body - was obsessed with devil doll Chucky from the Child's Play films.

A picture of the killer doll was found on the mobile phone he also used to film himself chopping up Cara's body.

Yesterday Anne-Marie from Southfields, South London, told how she endured an agonising four-hour wait for police to confirm her daughter had been murdered after a friend saw a report about the murder on Brazilian TV.

She said: ""The channel had shown Cara's body and the friend had recognised one of her tattoos.""

Cara's brother Michael Burke said the family asked Scotland Yard to help them speed up the investigation in Brazil.

One police theory is that Cara, who played for a Chelsea ladies' football team, had threatened to expose Dos Santos as a drug dealer and cocaine addict.

Her body was was discovered on Tuesday near the western city of Goiania, 120 miles south of the capital Brasilia. Dos Santos was yesterday helping police search a river for the rest of Cara's body.

Interpol's chief Jorge Pontes said: ""This sighting is still under investigation so we cannot reveal details. We have a witness insisting they saw the child on a flight to Sao Paulo.""

A foreign Embassy in Brazil reported the sighting to Interpol but Brazilian cops have refused to reveal which Embassy, claiming it could interfere with their investigations.

14,"""Friendly fire"" killed VC hero

A paratrooper awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery in Afghanistan may have been killed by so-called friendly fire, an inquest heard today.

Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment died in August 2006 after being shot in the abdomen during a fierce firefight with the Taliban in Sangin, Helmand Province.

The Assistant Deputy Coroner for Oxfordshire, Andrew Walker, today ruled that Cpl Budd had died in a crossfire.

The inquest in Oxford was told that Cpl Budd, 29, from Ripon, North Yorkshire, had also spearheaded an attack on an enemy position a month before his death, allowing a wounded colleague to be evacuated for life-saving treatment.

Earlier Mr Walker, heard that tests on fragments of the bullet which killed Cpl Budd showed it was likely to have been fired from a Nato weapon.

Ballistics expert Ed Wallace told the court that tests of 24 weapons used by Cpl Budd's comrades had failed to establish if any of them had fired the fatal shot.

But Mr Wallace said tests on two bullet fragments had established that they were from 5.56 calibre ammunition, which is used in rifles and machine guns issued to British troops.

After hearing Mr Wallace's evidence, the coroner told the hearing: ""In summary, I can be satisfied on the balance of probability that this was a Nato 5.56 projectile fired from a Nato weapon.""

Mr Wallace replied: ""Yes, that's the most likely cause.""

The posthumous award of the Victoria Cross - Britain's highest award for military bravery - to Cpl Budd was the first for almost a quarter of a century.

The soldier's widow Lorena accepted the honour, which he received for two separate acts of ""exceptional valour"" while deployed in southern Afghanistan, on his behalf in December 2006.

In a statement today, Mrs Budd said the inquest had been a difficult and emotional experience.

""Bryan laid down his life in an act of supreme valour,"" she said.

""By making the ultimate sacrifice, his conspicuous gallantry reflected the highest traditions of the Parachute Regiment.

""He did so doing the job he loved and serving in the regiment and with his fellow Paratroopers that meant so much to him.""

Mrs Budd, from Ripon, North Yorkshire, added: ""Bryan was a loving husband and father to our two daughters, Imogene and Isabel.

""He will always be missed, but his memory continues to live on. I would now ask that my family and I are left in peace to remember Bryan without intrusion into out privacy.""",uncertain,training

FOUR Royal Marine commandos fought off an ambush by 200 Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, it emerged yesterday.

The group - who had only been in the war-torn country five days - held off the rebels for four hours on Wednesday until reinforcements arrived.

The heroes were helped by soldiers from the Afghan National Army in what marines have dubbed Afghanistans Rorkes Drift.

During the battle, Pakistani mercenaries in the pay of Taliban warlords rained heavy gunfire and grenades from all directions.

The clash took place at an outstation known as Garmazia in the lawless Helmand region 30 miles from the Pakistan border.

The besieged commandos radioed for support with the message: We are surrounded.

At one point they looked death in the face as they were encircled by the advancing mob firing heavy machine guns.

They were only saved when an Apache helicopter arrived to hammer the insurgents.

The platoon house was too far from the main British base for a rescue party to be sent by land.

The marines, from 42 Commando, escaped with only minor injuries and two Afghan National Army soldiers were wounded.

A Royal Marines source said: This was an amazing show of true British grit and heroism and a triumph against all the odds. Our marines showed why they are the best in the world.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: These men are incredible professionals - the best we have.

Twenty-four British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since August.

British Olympic hopeful Tom Daley had a furious bust-up with diving partner Blake Aldridge after he blamed the youngster for the pair's failure to win an Olympic medal. 

Tom and Blake finished in eighth and last position in today's synchronised diving final.

After the competition Aldridge blasted 14-year-old Tom, the youngest competitor in the 2008 Olympic Games, for costing him a medal.

Aldridge, 26, accused Tom of having an attack of nerves and losing concentration because he was ""worrying about everyone and everything"".

The tension between the pair was obvious when feelings boiled over before the last of their two dives.

""He had a pop at me before the last dive, when we were sitting down,"" said Aldridge.

""I saw my mum in the audience and I asked her to give me a call and Tom went to me, 'Why are you on the phone? We're still in the competition and we've got another dive to do.'

""That's just Thomas - he's over-nervous and that's how it was today. Thomas should not be worrying about what I'm doing, but today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didn't perform today.""

Aldridge added: ""It's a synchro team, there's two of us, and that's the hard thing about it. Both of you have to be on your game at the same time and that just didn't happen today.

""Thomas is 14 years old. He's done phenomenally and for me to be a part of a partnership with him is a great thing. I knew, going into this Olympic Games, that we were capable of a medal, but I also knew that it depended on how Tom performed.

""I wasn't on the top of my game, but I out-dived Thomas today and that's not something that normally happens. That to me is because he had a lot more pressure on him than I did.

""I think it [the publicity] is the sole reason it went the way it did today, to be honest. I'm not disappointed with my performance.  I wasn't at my best but I landed on my head with every single dive, which was my aim. But it was hard work for me today.

""Tom was very nervous, more so than ever before. I think he really struggled to get through the competition, and as his partner it was hard for me to get up there and try and ease him into it. Unfortunately for me, it didn't work today.""

When asked about his thoughts on his performance Daley said: ""I was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and I really enjoyed myself.""

Daley, who will have another chance to go for Gold when he competes in the individual 10m platform event in 10 days' time, added: ""We just had a bad day.

""I tried to not make it feel different but there was lots of pressure on me and I was very nervous. It was there for the taking but it wasn't my day today. Now I'm looking at 2012, like I've always said.""

Aldridge concluded: ""Tom's lucky that he has got another chance and I hope he takes a lot of experience from this and that it stands him in good stead. Unfortunately I don't have another chance.""",uncertain,test
28,"Chinese Olympic torch guards are highly-trained killers

We reveal the sinister truth about the Olympic relay guards

The tracksuited Chinese security men guarding the Olympic torch are highly-trained killers from crack military special forces units.

Some were selected from the feared Flying Dragons and Sword of Southern China counter-terror units - which have regimes so brutal some recruits die within weeks.

Those who survive become experts in counter-terror and operating behind enemy lines.

Last night, the presence of the shadowy unit on British streets sparked fury.

And the revelation came as Chinese officials called off a chaotic relay of the torch in Paris yesterday after violent clashes between cops and protesters.

Damian Hockney of the Metropolitan Police Authority said: ""There's no way people like that should be allowed on our streets. If the parade cannot happen without UK police handling security alone it shouldn't happen at all. Who checked these people out?""

Colleague Jenny Jones added: ""I am curious what their status was and how far they would have gone. They looked mean. It was disturbing.""

Thirteen Chinese security men surrounded the torch as it was carried through London and wrestled with one protester as he tried to grab it from TV presenter Konnie Huq.

Konnie said: ""The men in blue perplexed everyone. Nobody seemed to know who they were. They were very robotic, full-on, and I noticed them having skirmishes with our own police and the Olympic authorities.

""They were barking orders, like 'Run! Stop!', and I was like, 'Who are these people?'. They kept pushing my hand up higher when I was holding the torch. They were...interesting.""

Scotland Yard said: ""Our responsibility was the safe passage of the torch bearer. Theirs was to maintain the flame. They were not employed by the Metropolitan Police.""

The Met couldn't comment on whether the guards had diplomatic status or were vetted before arriving.

A European military source said: ""These guys are literally trained within an inch of their lives. European and US special forces have to honour human right laws. The Chinese do not.

""A lot of recruits die within weeks. It is bloody and brutal.""

In combat, the men are used for high-intensity operations - typically ""decapitation operations"", killing off top officers.

The spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London was unavailable to comment.

The Paris relay was ended after violent clashes with protesters angry over China's treatment of Tibet. The torch was extinguished four times and there were 28 arrests.

The torch, which is fuelled by propane, carries the Olympic flame for each day's relays.

It is extinguished for flights and overnight, but the flame burns on in enclosed lanterns.

Overnight, it is in a hotel room with three members of the 10-strong protection team.

For air travel, where open flames are not allowed, the flame burns in the enclosed lanterns, which act like miners' lamps.

She is the woman responsible for Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna's ""buff bodies"" but celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson is a lady with a very shady past.

Paltrow has reportedly bank-rolled the Tracy Anderson Method Studio in trendy Tribeca, New York, amid reports that the pair are struggling to recruit members to their pricey private gym.

The last time Anderson had similar problems at her Pilates studio in Fisher's Crossing, Indiana, she simply placed a yellow sticker on the door saying the studio was shut for maintenance - but she never returned leaving her clients in the lurch. Anderson was subsequently sued by several clients and by a former landlord for $450,000. She filed bankruptcy to avoid payment.

The toned blonde was jailed briefly in December 2006 for failing to pay on another outstanding ruling and was she also sued for $100,000 by a former student and the Indiana Consumer Protection Agency launched a probe into her financial dealings in mid 2007 on a recommendation of The Indiana Attorney General's Office.

Before opening her new NY gym last month, the trainer made mega-bucks being on Madonna's payroll where she traveled to the star's homes in London, Miami, New York and Los Angeles, to make sure that she was in tip-top condition at all times.

Commenting on Anderson's unusual techniques Paltrow said: ""It's fun because it's not like you're running mindlessly on a treadmill. I guess she learned how to make the muscles do certain things - it actually works. It's not like you're chasing this dream.""

Paltrow and Anderson have appeared on Oprah showing off their stealthy moves but its understood that the economic downturn has hit their new business venture.

Prospective NY members - who must be approved by the owners - have to stump up a reported $4500 just to join plus hefty monthly fees.
A spokesperson at The Tracy Anderson Studios in LA said: ""We have various packages available but for LA it is $575 per month for three months - New York is much more expensive and you must contact them via e-mail.""

""She's forking out for cars and a flash lifestyle, yet thinking she shouldn't pay taxes like the rest of us.""

He added: ""There is no suggestion he doesn't have the funds to meet his tax liabilities.

""It is just a question of having time to make the returns.

He made the investments as he prepared to move to the United Arab Emirates to open a bar with Chris Evans but the proposed business never got off the ground.

Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was already in hot water with members of the international community over his controversial (and extremely hilarious) Borat character, and now President George Bush himself is going to weigh in.

The government of Kazakhstan became infuriated with Cohen over his portrayal of Borat, a bumbling Kazakh TV reporter, at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon. The upcoming movie, based on Borat's adventures in the US, has surely reopened the wound.

In the opening scene, Borat reportedly kisses goodbye to his sister (who he touts as one of the top prostitutes in all of Kazakhstan by the way) and sets off for America in a car pulled by a horse. The movie was hailed as a comedic gem when it debuted last week at the Toronto International Film Festival.

But not everyone is laughing, especially Kazakhstan's president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is set to meet with President Bush in the coming weeks. Among their list of topics to discuss is the damage done to his country's image by the Borat character.

President Nazarbayev also claims his government will buy ""educational"" TV spots and print advertisements about the ""real Kazakhstan"" in a bid to save the country's reputation before the film is released in the U.S. in November. 

Despite the hilarity of the situation, The Kazakh government is very serious about the issue.

According to the book, Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega installed cameras on Contadora Island, which was a safe haven where American politicians and businessmen could schmooze with, and bribe, Latin American politicos. There were ""rumors that George W. was photographed doing coke and having kinky sex during the time his father was president,"" Jose, a top adviser to Brazilian president Lula da Silva, tells Perkins. ""There was a theory in Latin America that Noriega had used incriminating photos of the younger Bush and his cronies to convince the older Bush, then president, to side with the Panamanian administration on key issues.

74,"Africa... Bush's secret triumph

For 25 years, I have sought to tell presidents, prime ministers, princes, popes and pop stars about Africa.

There have been occasional successes and many years of frustration and failure.

But this time, to my great surprise, it was the President of the United States inviting me to join him on a visit there.

When I arrived with George W Bush in Rwanda the streets assumed a festive air. They like him.

Prostitutes came to wave him on for saving them and their children's lives.

The President paused here on his whistle-stop tour of Africa to show he and America have tried to share that burden.

In truth, what Bush does or thinks or plans has in political terms become almost meaningless. The curtain is already almost down. Bush has rocked America's core idea of itself and most of the world's idea of America during his presidency.

He may not be forgiven and he certainly won't be forgotten for this.

But while Americans looked away from their unrecognisable selves, America was doing something that rightfully belongs to its own deathless ideal of the good, the fair and the just.

It has been happening quietly and out of sight - the unannounced, unheralded good legacy of this administration.

The great unacknowledged story of America in Africa didn't immediately originate with this President - John Kerry and Bill Frist initiated legislation in 2002 to combat the continent's Aids epidemic.

But it has been accelerated hugely by him, increased by him, argued for by him and monitored by him. It has saved millions of lives and healed broken bodies; more than 1.5million Africans are on lifesaving antiretrovirals (anti-HIV drugs).

And it has put millions of the poorest of the earth - an additional 29million African children - into schools.

It has fed, clothed and watered the hurt and ill.

Unusually, it is being done deftly, slowly and gently with due respect to the dignity of those it seeks to help.

It has not finished and it is still not enough, but it is without any doubt what America is supposed to do, which is why US citizens should know of it.

Why did Bush travel here this week? Perhaps simply to say goodbye as President?

Maybe one day he will return again as a free man with his family - all of whom seem to have fallen in love with this beautiful place - to see up close the impact of his unsung efforts.

Tanzanian politicians have shown how US investment has been spurred by Bush's Millennium Challenge legislation.

And the Liberians thank Bush for the huge overt support that has stabilised their country.

Increasingly effective aid and trade backing good governance have helped provide education, skills and jobs and improve health.

The US gets 19 per cent of its oil imports from Africa and the figure is rising; in China, it's 30 per cent and rising. Now Europe must look more to Africa to avoid Russian oil.

The Chinese and Indians are massive investors in Africa, and so must the West be - but America has begun well.

Americans should feel good about this - and they would, if anyone would tell them about it.

On Air Force One, the President and I discussed this luminous continent, drenched in light and hope, grace and spirit. ""Whoever is President next must understand that Africa is in our nation's interest,"" he told me.

We hear from all the presidential candidates promises to build in a post-partisan manner on the legacy of Bush in Africa - but will they?

A fresh world is being shaped here and it is vital it is understood by America.

I look forward to seeing what the next President will do to continue this great, untold and secret American story.

But others could argue they were listening to the very people who elected them, the vast majority of whom bitterly oppose the deal. Many say the high-stakes card sharks gambled big and they've lost big - and they were betting with our money.

The taxpayer resents having to put his hand in his pocket just so fat cats can do it all again. The feeling is, heads they win, tails we lose.

Killing off the proposal would have shown Congress was in touch with voters. If only it were as simple as that. Rejecting the deal would have made the situation a whole lot worse. It may seem as if banks are dropping like flies now. Without a massive cash injection, many more will fail.

Paralysis of the money markets, recession and raging unemployment threaten to ensue.

But despite the inevitable pain, the world will go on turning.

Those ""bad"" banks still with toxic debts are likely to go the wall but the ""good"" ones will thrive. The downside is less competition when it comes to current accounts, loans and mortgages. And the taxpayer will pick up the tab one way or another. More banks will be nationalised, as has happened with Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley.

And the economy, already reeling, will take an almighty hammering.

Investment bank BNP Paribas believes the UK economy alone will take a $200bn hit over the next five years if the deal does not go through.

Yet some believe there is a third way that prevents all-out anarchy without lumbering the British taxpayer with dodgy assets.

One option is to buy shares in troubled banks. That way it would still inject the necessary money and enable the taxpayer to benefit from the bank's long-term recovery.

Others argue the only way to cure banks of their innate greed is to rip up the rule book and start again.

Only with this level of shock to the system are City dealers likely to change their ways.

It might seem like a doomsday scenario but it could teach the banks a lesson that ensures we never find ourselves in this mess again.",uncertain,training

Three convicted terrorists who plotted to kidnap and behead a British Muslim soldier have been freed early from jail.

Hamid Elasmar, 46, Zahoor Iqbal, 32, and Mohammed Irfan, 33, were all caged less than two years ago.

They had been given between three and seven years for helping to plan the Birmingham kidnap of a squaddie, who they plotted to behead ""like a pig"" in a lock-up garage.

But the trio have now been released early for good behaviour.

During their trials, a court heard how the gang met at Elasmar's Edgbaston council flat to plot the release of video footage of the planned killing.

Plot mastermind Parviz Khan, 39 - now serving 14 years - was recorded by security services saying he intended to parade the soldier's head on a pole.

The mother of a child victim of the IRA's Warrington bombings died of a broken heart on the 16th anniversary of his death, an inquest heard.

A coroner said: ""She died due to natural causes, but we know what was breaking her heart.""

Johnathan died along with 12-year-old Tim Parry when terrorists put bombs in litter bins in Warrington, Cheshire, in 1993. More than 50 were injured.

97,"Bye Borishh: Boozy Yeltsin dies

Boozy Boris Yeltsin - who saved Russia from Communism - died yesterday after a lifelong battle with the bottle.

The former Russian leader won global plaudits after his death from heart failure was announced.

Yeltsin, 76, spent nine years in the Kremlin after becoming Russia's first democratically elected president in 1991.

The ex-Communist played a key role in the collapse of the evil Soviet Union - and creating Russian democracy.

He gave millions of Russians freedom of speech, freedom to travel and freedom to take part in elections.

And he set up a free market system where every trade and business had previously been owned by the State.

Silver-haired Boris - a lumbering, bear-like figure - first won worldwide admiration in 1991 when he climbed aboard a Red Army tank in Moscow to single-handedly kill a government coup.

The city's ex-mayor risked his life as he ordered troops not to strangle democracy at birth by overthrowing the then president Mikhail Gorbachev.

But vodka-lover Boris will also be remembered for heavy drinking and at times eccentric behaviour.

In 1995 he pinched a secretary's bum in front of TV cameras. Six years earlier he was found at the Kremlin soaked from head to foot wearing only his underpants.

He played the spoons on the head of neighbouring Kyrgyzstan's President.

And in 1994 he stunned officials on a boat on the Volga by ordering his guards to toss his spokesman into the river.

The sozzled father of two seized the conductor's baton at a sombre ceremony to mark the reunification of Germany.

And on a trip to Ireland he was so drunk he couldn't get off his jet - leaving the embarrassed Irish PM on the tarmac with an army band.

Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996 after his campaign was rescued by Roman Abramovich - now Chelsea's owner.

The Russian Bear enjoyed good relations with Tory PM John Major, then Tony Blair.

Soon after Mr Blair entered No 10, Yeltsin declared Russian nuclear missiles would no longer point at Britain.

Yeltsin quit on New Year's Eve 1999 after a succession of health problems and handed power to Vladimir Putin.

Last night world leaders saluted Yeltsin - in contrast to many Russians who hated his changes to the economy, which saw wages plummet.

Mr Blair said: ""He was a remarkable man who saw the need for democratic and economic reform and, in defending it, played a vital role at a crucial time in Russia's history.""

Some paused to lay flowers and reflect on the life of the man who ushered in a post-Soviet Russia, but ended his career divorced from power and carrying the faint odour of disgrace - remembered as much for his love of vodka as defeating a coup.

Dressed in a black tie and suit, his coffin lay inside Moscow's golden-domed Christ the Saviour Cathedral - a replica of the original on the banks of the Moscow River blown up in 1931 by the Communist party, and which Yeltsin's early leadership is credited as being instrumental in helping build.

The man hands her a rolled-up dollar bill and she proceeds to walk a few steps to a table where the cocaine is cut. She pulls her hair back, bends down and snorts a line.

Four lines of white powdery substance are clearly visible on the table, which is in front of a computer.

After she snorts the first line, the woman said to be Ashley lifts her head and wipes her nose. She then snorts a second and third line before the tape cuts off.

There are worse things to be than a foxy young woman without kids-unless you want to score a co-anchor slot on NBC's Today Show. Despite widespread reports that Campbell Brown, co-host of the top-rated morning show's weekend edition, was on the very short list of potential successors for the CBS-bound Katie Couric, a source who was involved in NBC's decision making process tells Brown never really had a shot, on account of her youth, looks, and, especially, her lack of kids.

According to the source, network executives considered Brown, who is also a regular correspondent on NBC Nightly News and a former White House correspondent, at least as qualified as any other contenders, and possibly the best-suited to the demands of the show's news-driven 7 a.m. hour. Nevertheless, NBC brass concluded that Today's core audience of stay-at-home moms would have trouble relating to a female host without rugrats of her own, banter about kids and spouses being as essential a part of Today's mix as cooking segments and Al Roker.

Then it came. Dubya burbled that she had helped America ""celebrate its bicentennial in 17 ...""

Bush caught himself - just in time - and corrected the date to 1976. He paused as if to see if the Queen had taken offence, winked at her then said shamefacedly to the huge gathering: ""She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child.""

After that initial icy grimace the Queen laughed, too.

But she suffered another gaffe later, this time courtesy of screen legend Mickey Rooney. The 86-year-old actor had waited nervously in line with wife Jan at a garden party at the British Embassy. As the Queen approached he gave her a smart salute.

When she offered her hand Rooney took it and broke with Royal protocol by planting a kiss on the top of her glove. But the Queen just smiled and chatted to the couple. Rooney said afterwards: ""This was just such a big thrill for me to meet the Queen. It is something I've dreamed of all my life.""

The two gaffes join a long list of US blunders. In 1991, George Bush Senior was at the centre of ""Podiumgate"".

When the Queen gave her address on the White House lawn all that could be seen above the microphones was her hat after someone forgot to put a raised platform in place. The next day she quipped as she gave another speech: ""I do hope you can see me today.""

Also in 1991, Dubya admitted he was the black sheep of his family and turned to HM and asked ""Who's yours?"" The Queen, wisely, did not reply.

John Stamos says he was targeted by a pair of alleged blackmailers who threatened to sell so-called compromising photos of him unless he coughed up $680,000.

Allison Coss, 23, and Scott Sippola, 30, of Marquette, Mich., were arrested last week in an FBI sting operation after they met with an undercover agent, posing as a Stamos representative, to collect their money in a Michigan airport, according to a Dec 3 FBI affidavit obtained by thesmokinggun.com.

After police raided their home, they discovered three photos of Stamos, a piece of paper with the actor's personal cell phone number on it, and a list of three tabloid magazines with contact numbers for each, according to the affidavit.

Stamos -- described as ""Mr. X"" in affidavit -- was vacationing in Florida in 2004 when he met Coss. At the time, the pair and another pal attended a party where photos were allegedly taken of the former Full House star, 46.

Following the party, the actor stayed in touch via email with Coss, according to the FBI.

Last month, Stamos -- now starring in the Broadway revival Bye Bye Birdie -- began receiving email threats from a person named ""Brian L"" who allegedly demanded $680,000 from Stamos or else the photos would be sold to a tabloid. In emails, Coss alerted Stamos that she was involved in the plot.

The affidavit did not describe the photos, but Stamos was told they would ""cause harm"" to his reputation if released. (No word whether the photos were taken before or after he and actress Rebecca Romijn announced their split that year.)

Friends of the actress claim that she hooked up with Rossini after meeting him one night at Elaine's restaurant in Manhattan.

A source also confirmed that Sippola and Coss are romantically involved.

An affidavit from an FBI agent said that Stamos, identified as ""Mr. X"", attended a party with Coss in 2004 during which photos were taken. Stamos stayed in email contact with Coss. Last month, Stamos received communication from a man threatening to damage the actor's reputation by releasing the photos unless the actor paid him $680,000.

A sting operation was set up by the FBI and Sippola and Coss were arrested at a Michigan airport.

Was Sippola's nightclub going bankrupt and is that why he tried to extort Stamos? The closing of Matrixx would seem to point in that direction but one nearby business owner told that he believes Sippola has plenty of money and was going to reopen his club after remodeling it.

The site also advises paedophiles on how to download child porn without being caught.

Oldfield uses the telephone and the post to direct his online sex offenders' network.

One rant on the website's message board states: ""Everyone will have sex with anyone unless they restrict themselves - so everyone is a bisexual paedophile. The common sense position is that it is biologically normal that adolescents are sexually attractive.""

In response to a music teacher being jailed for downloading 38,000 child porn images, another posting says: ""This man has harmed no-one, and is being forced to pretend that he hates his sexuality.

""I'm in a similar situation, having been twice convicted of possession of child pictures. I've just finished a sex offenders' course. Two-and-a-half hours of mind-numbing tedium each week was the real punishment.""

The site also provides ""model answers"" to those caught downloading child porn to help them escape prosecution and offers technical explanations so paedophiles can claim they viewed images by mistake.

Oldfield was arrested in August 2002 after a shopper saw him taking pictures of children in Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre. Police then discovered child porn images on computers at his flat in Doncaster. He set up the website, which the Mirror has chosen not to name, while out on licence after serving eight months for possessing child porn.

""He's made contact with his cronies for the day-to-day running of the site, while he is still on hand to offer his sick form of ""advice"".

""The worry is site users have their warped opinions reinforced by other paedophiles and go on to abuse. It makes their behaviour seem normal and seeks to justify their actions.

And when he raced into a 3-0 lead in the third, victory looked a formality.

But then came the fightback with Baghdatis taking the next five games to leave his opponent stunned.

With each winning point the Cypriot beat his chest to raise the tempo among his fans to such a point that police ordered them to tone it down. And Wimbledon wonders why it has a stuffy reputation.

Baghdatis went on to break Djokovic's tie-break stranglehold, taking the third set after that too had gone to the wire. And in the fourth set of this gripping encounter, the bearded bruiser drew level after a net cord wrong-footed Djokovic.

Yet in the end it was was Baghdatis who blinked first, a string of unforced errors in the 12th game of the fifth set leaving Djokovic serving for the match. This time the exciting young Serb made no mistake.

Baghdatis said afterwards: ""I had my chances and I didn't take them. But I gave a good fight and I am proud of myself. I will give Rafa 60-40 in the semi because Djokovic is tired. Normally I would give 50-50.""

Exhausted Djokovic, who has now been on court for a total of 17 hours this Wimbledon, sings the Gloria Gaynor anthem ""I Will Survive"" on YouTube.

He joked: ""Now you know why I sing that! Actually I am really disappointed that no-one has asked me to record it.""

Getting serious, he added: ""I have played more or less every day this tournament because of the rain. Rafael has spent much less time than me on court. But I will try to do my best.""",uncertain,training
133,"Roger Federer sets sights on nappy-changing after Wimbledon win

Roger Federer has conquered the tennis world but admits he now faces a tougher task - learning to change a nappy.

The new world No.1 had just two hours sleep on Monday after celebrating his sixth Wimbledon crown - and his record 15th Grand Slam title.

But the 27-year-old will have to get used to such short nights as his wife Mirka is expecting their first child next month.

And the greatest tennis player of all time admits he is a complete novice when it comes to child's play.

""I've not yet changed a nappy, I've been saving myself,"" said Federer. ""I have to practise. I have to go and ask for some advice from some people. Tiger Woods and I spoke about it a bit. He said it would be fine, but exciting, different. It's good and nice.""

Federer always had great timing. And after becoming only the fourth man in the Open era to win Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year to set the new Grand Slam titles record, the pressure of expectation is removed before the future tennis star is born.

But he insisted Mirka, a former tennis pro he met at the Sydney Olympics, will not allow him to clutter their Swiss chalet all year. ""With fatherhood and the baby maybe I'll get up earlier for practice, do things a bit different and not be so crazy as a professional,"" he said.

""I definitely have to regroup after this victory and get in the right frame of mind for rest of the season. I want to finish the season as No. 1. ""I can't just be at home for the next six months. Mirka wouldn''t let me. She wants to see me play and I want to be with her on the tour instead of just sitting at home. That is not life for me.""

Unlike Woods, who is chasing Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 Majors, Federer no longer has a target to aim for. But he agreed with Pete Sampras' assertion that he could go on to win 18 or 19 Grand Slam titles.

He said: ""I'm not worried that I'll be like, ""What now? I've reached everything, there's no more point in playing, it's better just to retire"". I'm too young, too eager to really do well.

""I've been in 16 or 17 Grand Slam finals so if I do it again, I don't think I'm going to lose every Grand Slam final I'll be in. I'll definitely win a few. Then again, this could have been my last so you have to enjoy it while you have it.""

Federer, who lost a five-set classic to Rafa Nadal last year, admitted his celebrations this time were deliberately restrained out of respect for beaten finalist Andy Roddick. ""It was an amazing moment in my career, but I know the pain Andy must have gone through and that's one of the reasons I didn't go overly crazy about the victory on the court,"" he said.

""But it's going to make him stronger and from my side it's a dream.""",uncertain,test

Tony Blair's blundering bodyguard left a deadly loaded pistol in full view of coffee shop customers and their children.

The semi-automatic Glock 17 remained on the floor of the Starbucks cafe's only toilet for nearly 20 minutes.

The bodyguard, a girl cop who is the former PM's close protection officer, left it there after spending a penny while on duty.

It was eventually found by a horrified Starbucks employee, who called 999.

Armed police rushed to the cafe to recover it.

Linked

Meanwhile the high-flying officer, in her 30s and wearing plain clothes, was searching frantically for the gun after realising her mistake.

She spent nearly an hour trying to retrace her steps.

The pistol was eventually linked to her when cops compared its serial number to those logged at a police armoury.

Scotland Yard chiefs hit the roof. And the bodyguard, whose job is to protect Mr Blair from al-Qaeda terrorists, has been ""removed from operational duties"".

A senior police source said last night: ""She knows she has messed up bad."" The officer, attached to the Yard's crack SO1 protection unit, was caught short while on Edgware Road, Central London - near one of Mr Blair's homes.

She took off a belt holding the Glock while she relieved herself in the Starbucks toilet - used by men and women, boys and girls.

After leaving the loo the absent-minded cop stopped to buy a coffee and then walked out - completely forgetting she had left the gun behind.

The police source said: ""Luckily it was found in time, but if a child or a criminal had picked it up there could have been terrible consequences.

""This has come as a shock. The officer is inconsolable and seriously regrets her mistake.""

The source added: ""Everyone is fond of her.

""She was among the top in her class during training, but her firearms career could be over.""

Armed female cops have been griping for years about the bulky design of their gun belts. Male officers do not need to remove theirs to spend a penny - but the girls do.

The source said no decision has been made about the bodyguard's long-term future.

Her SO1 unit - full name Specialist Protection Command - is responsible for the personal safety of Prime Minister Gordon Brown and ex-PMs Mr Blair and Margaret Thatcher.

It also guards Cabinet ministers, ambassadors and high-profile individuals who are considered terrorist targets.

Scotland Yard said last night: ""A police-issue firearm was left unattended in a central London cafe.

""The weapon belongs to a Metropolitan Police authorised firearm officer who was on duty at the time. An investigation has begun.

A Muslim could one day be Prime Minister, Tony Blair said last night.

Speaking exclusively to, the PM said: ""They said there would never be a woman Prime Minister, but there was. It would depend on how good they were.

""The people would judge who was best for the job.""

The Premier also said he would not mind if any of his children wanted to marry a Muslim, saying: ""I would respect it, if that was their decision and they were in love and happy.""

Earlier, he delivered a lecture on race and religion in front of an invited audience of community leaders, race chiefs and the media.

He celebrated the contribution made by Britain's ethnic minorities and praised the wider community's acceptance of people's backgrounds.

He said Britain was a haven for all people and praised interview with Arsenal's French footballer Thierry Henry, in which he claimed Britain was one of the world's most tolerant countries. Mr Blair said: ""I read it. I thought it was excellent. And I think Thierry Henry is a really great bloke, by the way.""

The PM said Britain had changed for the better in the last 30 years, with offensive remarks and stupid stereotypes driven out of everyday conversation. According to figures, only 12 per cent of people would mind if a close relative married a black or Asian person.

Mr Blair again acknowledged that he would not have a problem if his son or daughter brought home a Muslim.

But he again defended Commons Leader Jack Straw's comments over the veil - while pointing out that most extremists were young men, not women in niqabs.

He said it was a matter of common sense that, when speaking to someone, you could see their face.

Mr Blair called Channel 4's Alternative Christmas Message, which will feature a woman wearing a veil for the first time, ""a joke"".

He said: ""I won't be watching. I'll be watching the Queen's speech.""

Mr Blair pointed out that there was a great deal of discussion on the issue of veils going on within the Muslim community.

The PM added: ""When Jack Straw made his comments, no less a person than the Mufti of the Arab Republic of Egypt made an approving statement.""

Mr Blair pleased Muslims members of his audience by referring to extremists as a ""fringe element"".

Many Muslims feel aggrieved over the way the war on terror has been handled and feel they have been tainted and are all under suspicion.

But Mr Blair defined a moderate Muslim, saying this was ""someone who believes if you have a disagreement with someone, then you change it by peaceful means"".

He said it was not about how religion was practised, but stressed that it was everyone's duty to integrate.

He added: ""If you are permitted to stay here permanently, you become an equal member of our community and become one of us.""

Mr Blair argued the great thing about Britain is that people can worship as they wish.

He said his family would be going to church on Christmas Eve.

139,"Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to blame over Iraq war, says Army report

A secret report by Army bosses to be presented to the Iraq war inquiry blames Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for the botched occupation of the country.

The dossier - prepared for ex-military chief General Sir Mike Jackson - criticises then Chancellor Mr Brown for withholding funds to rebuild Basra for FIVE months after our troops went in. And the 100-page document attacks Mr Blair for ""uncritically"" accepting flawed US plans for the March 2003 invasion, which led to tens of thousands of deaths, including those of 179 British troops.

The report - Stability Operations in Iraq - will not be officially made public because the inquiry's head, Sir John Chilcot, ruled all documents will remain secret.

But the contents have been leaked to.

We can reveal that a lack of cash for the operation meant British troops sent to fight in Iraq:

Used mobile phones to communicate in combat because radios did not work.

Were forced to leave wounded soldiers on the battlefield for an average of two-and-half hours before getting them to a field hospital.

Needed more ""spy in the sky"" aircraft to track rebel fighters.

Lacked machine guns, night- vision equipment and grenade launchers when protecting supply convoys.

Were in danger of breaching the Geneva Convention by having so few resources. The convention says occupiers must provide vital services such as humanitarian aid and water.

In a broadside at the then PM Mr Blair, the report says the battle for the hearts and minds of ordinary Iraqis was lost because of a lack of planning and the five-month delay in starting to rebuild their country.

It says: ""The failures to plan... seriously hindered Coalition chances of stabilising post-Saddam Iraq. The lack of improvements to essential services and the standard of living together with disorder meant many locals who were 'sitting on the fence' were not persuaded to support the Coalition.""

It was only after riots in Basra in August 2003 that Mr Brown agreed to release $500million for reconstruction work, the report says.

And it contradicts six years of Government spin which claimed ordinary Iraqis backed the ""liberation"", saying troops ""found themselves fighting insurgents without clear support (from local people)"".

Flawed US plans were rubberstamped by Blair

Brown blocked vital funding for five months

Roger Federer broke down in tears yesterday after seeing his bid to become a Grand Slam record holder wrecked by brilliant Rafa Nadal.

The Swiss former world No.1 could not control his emotions after another epic confrontation between the pair left him still one major title short of matching the 14 achieved by Pete Sampras.

""God, it's killing me,"" Federer sobbed during the presentation ceremony after Nadal won the Australian Open 7-5 3-6 7-6 3-6 6-2 in a match lasting four hours 22 minutes in Melbourne.

""Rafa congrats, you played incredible, you deserve it man. You played another fantastic final.

""In the first moment you're disappointed, you're shocked, you're sad, then all of a sudden it overwhelms you. The problem is you can't go in the locker room and just take it easy and take a cold shower.

""You're stuck out there. It's the worst feeling. It's rough.""

Even Nadal, who has now won Grand Slam titles on clay, grass and hard court, apologised for turning on his rival's emotional tap.

He said: ""Roger, sorry for today.

I really know how you feel right now. Remember, you're a great champion, you're one of the best in history.

""You're going to improve on the 14 of Sampras.""

The contest was 26 minutes shorter than their incredible Wimbledon final last summer but the quality was just as high as the pair cemented their positions as the best two players in the world.

Federer though hit far too many unforced errors, 29 of his 64 coming off his backhand, and he also had an off day with his serve, hitting six double faults, including one which gave Nadal his second championship point.

And he could only manage to convert six of his 19 break points as well.

As the players slugged it out, Nadal required two separate spells of massage to his right thigh during the third set and later admitted he had gone into the final with a hamstring niggle as a result of his record-breaking five hours, 14 minutes on court against Fernando Verdasco in the semi-finals.

""In the third set it started to pull.

There was no cramping but it was scary,"" said Nadal, the first man to win titles on all surfaces since Andre Agassi.

In a topsy-turvey match of breathtaking rallies and shot-making, Nadal struck the killer blow when he broke in the fourth game of the deciding set when 21-9-a-zear-old Federer netted a backhand.

He broke his rival's serve again in the eighth game to seal a famous victory in the first five-set final here since Mats Wilander beat Pat Cash in 1988.

After receiving the trophy from Aussie tennis legend Rod Laver, Nadal, 23, said: ""This is very special, it's a dream to win here, a grand slam on hard court.

""I have worked very hard all my life to improve my tennis outside of clay. I have six (Grand Slam titles) right now, I'm happy with my six.

""Every title is tough to win. I don't know if I'm gonna win more, but for sure I'm gonna continue trying.

""When I won my first one I didn't know if I would win any more.

British tennis ace opens up in his autobiography

Andy Murray has attacked the attitude and commitment of other British tennis players, accusing them of being lazy.

Since the retirement of Tim Henman, Murray has been the lone British man in the world's top 100 players and despite LTA targets to boost that number, the situation shows no sign of changing any time soon.

British men's number two Jamie Baker has a career high of 211 while women's number one Anne Keothavong has a career best of 96, achieved last month.

And 21-year-old Murray, 16th in the world, reckons it is time British tennis admits it has a major problem rather than ploughing on hoping things will improve, as he uses new autobiography Hitting Back to say exactly what he thinks of his fellow players.

He blasted: ""There is something wrong with the mentality and work ethic of most of the British players.

""There doesn't seem to be anyone who's brutally honest about it either.

""I think the best way is to confront it, especially when it has been so bad for so long.

""Someone in authority at British tennis should come out and say: 'Look we're doing really BADLY. We're not good enough. We must make some changes.'

""But everyone is being really unrealistic with goals: things like: 'We're going to get eight players in the top 100 by 2008 and then it changed to seven players in the top 100 by 2010. Which players are they then?

""I'm away a lot of the time but I turn up at the National Training Centre in Roehampton, the multi-million pound headquarters of British tennis and no-one is there.

""I'm often looking for a partner to hit with and I have to call one of the coaches to try and find someone. I would say that a large number of British players only practise half the days in the year. 

""The LTA have built the facilities but the players don't make the best use of them.

""When I go to the gym there never seems to be anyone in there.

""Basically, I have the equipment to myself, which is great for me but what a waste.""

And rather than splashing out money on flash coaches, Murray believes they would be better off focusing on getting British players properly fit and prepared for the demands of the tennis circuit.

He explained: ""To my mind, the LTA should not spend so much money on a number of the world's greatest coaches.

""That does not mean I am ungrateful for my time with Brad but I think British tennis at this stage needs good, experienced fitness coaches and physiotherapists who understand the demands of the game.

""To me, that is more of a priority than the tennis. The players have to understand what hard work is.""

The pic - the first ever image taken of a solar transit of a space shuttle and Hubble Space Telescope - was taken by an amateur astronomer from his back garden.

Grace Mugabe, glamorous wife of the Zimbabwean president, went on a shopping spree within hours of arriving in Paris on Wednesday.

Back home, six million people face starvation, unable to afford exorbitant prices for grain controlled by the country's military elite.

But then Grace, 37, is one of the Dictators' Wives, a select band of women whose luxurious lifestyles are funded by their husbands' evil regimes.

Their talent for spending and addiction to excess make TV's fictional Footballers' Wives look like a bunch of spinsters on an economy drive, as our Tale Of The Tape, below, shows.

Grace's lavish spending is so notorious she is known back home as The First Shopper, an ironic play on American presidents' wives being called The First Lady.

It is hubby Robert Mugabe's 79th birthday tomorrow - but Grace was mainly shopping for herself.

She wears only clothes and shoes with designer labels, with Gucci and Hermes her favourites.

Before EU sanctions curbed their freedom to travel around Europe, the Mugabes used to use a DC-9 airliner to go shopping in London, Rome and Paris as well as New York.

In London Grace stayed in a luxury suite at Claridge's Hotel while stocking up on Church's shoes, Harrods bathrobes and - a main cause of her expanding bottom - Godiva chocolates.

After being forced to ditch the jet, Grace turned to spending at home - by shopping for houses.

A building for civil servants was taken over and became a $500,000 palace for her, which she modestly named Gracelands.

She also acquired five farms seized at gunpoint from their white owners.

The partners of other dictators can hit the shops too.

Sajida Hussein, 65, cousin and wife of Iraqi dictator Saddam, wears lavishly-embroidered Italian clothes and has three hairdressers, interchanging them depending on her mood. And that mood can be frightening.

One servant had her tongue torn out for spreading gossip. Another was beaten to death for sniggering at Sajida after Saddam had a much-publicised affair with an airline official.

Mira Markovic, wife of Serbian ex-dictator Slobodan Milosevic, collects designer furs. Her favourite is a blond Russian sable from Corniche of New York.

She insists on eating only Iranian caviar and wears French perfumes, especially Estee Lauder and Yves Saint Laurent.

Today Mira, 60, is more of a joke than a menace - not so Kim Yong Suk, wife of North Korean ""Dear Leader"", ""Great Leader"", ""Beloved Father Of His People"" etc, Kim Jong Il. Yong Suk - her age is a state secret - is a former typist who replaced Kim's first wife, Sung Hye Rim, 30 years ago.

Hye Rim was exiled to Switzerland, where she lived in a luxury villa in Geneva and travelled around Europe.

Yong Suk was restricted to the odd journey to China where she bought pirated videos, being a big Hollywood film fan like her husband.

She apparently became so jealous of the first Mrs Kim that the latter vanished from Geneva seven years ago.

Some say Hye Rim defected to South Korea. Others say she was assassinated by a North Korean hit squad on Yong Suk's orders.

The nearest Yong Suk comes to a designer label is Marks & Spencer knickers, airlifted to Korea in planes carrying her husband's favourite French wines.

Safiya Gaddafi, second wife of Libyan dictator and self-appointed Colonel Gadaffi, is a big fan of London's Dorchester Hotel.

She and her daughter Hanna often share a $1,500-a-night suite while going on shopping sprees in the Knightsbridge, where one of their favourite stores is Harrods.

Queen of the shoe shoppers is Imelad Marcos, 73-year-old widow of Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos.

She travelled the world buying designer shoes by the likes of Givenchy, Chanel, Ferragamo and Christian Dior.

After the couple fled to Hawaii in 1986 3,000 pairs, all size 8, were found in her huge shoe room in the couple's palace.

But Imelda, now back living in the Philippines, reckons her shoe fetish is exaggerated and says: ""I did not have 3,000 pairs of shoes - I had 1,060.""",uncertain,test
158,"Gripping inquest ends

More than 10 years after the fateful crash in Paris which killed Princess Diana and her lover Dodi Fayed - their joint inquest finally got underway.

The jury in the inquest of the doomed couple heard murder claims, lies and even saw a cameo from Victoria Beckham.

Mohamed al Fayed gave a hint of the drama that was to come last year when he stood at the High Court gates telling the world the couple had been ""murdered"" by the Royal Family.

And then the panel was taken to Paris where they retraced the couple's steps through Mr al Fayed's Ritz Hotel and walked through the Alma Tunnel, scene of the tragedy.

For two days they examined mundane traffic lights, bollards and white lines - lent an almost mystical significance in the public mind by the events of August 31 1997.

Peeping through the curtains on their coach they were given a glimpse of Diana's world when Victoria Beckham strode out of the Ritz to the delight of a bank of photographers.

Back in London they studied hotel CCTV footage and partially obscured stills of the scene in the crashed car, a private view of the final hours of a life lived so publicly.

But after briefly delving into topics such as the dangers of drink-driving or the merits of seatbelts, the evidence quickly moved on to what, for some, was the real subject matter: the couple's private lives.

For weeks we heard about Diana's divorce, her private paranoias, her lovers, her choice of contraceptive, even her menstrual cycle.

But questions such as the road layout at the tunnel, the high accident rate and the issue of seatbelts went largely unchallenged.

Stepmother Raine, Countess Spencer, Lady Annabel Goldsmith and Lady Sarah McCorquodale headed a line-up of titled witnesses taking the stand.

The barristers - and the ever-present media - were eager to know what each thought of whether Diana was pregnant, and whether Dodi was ""the one"".

A procession of mystics including Diana's medium Rita Rogers, ""energy healer"" Simone Simmons and holistic therapist Myriah Daniels also shared their insights.

Not since the Salem Witch Trials have so many witnesses with an eye for the supernatural taken centre stage in a western courtroom.

Resplendent in a black twin set and pearls, raven-haired Mrs Rogers told the court how, with hindsight, she ""didn't have a very good feeling"" when she spoke to Diana for the last time hours before her death.

No-one asked what her prediction for the verdict was.

It is unclear whether when Paul Burrell - Diana's former butler who now markets his own range of luxury products in the US - turned up he expected to bask in her reflected glory.

The grilling he received instead was ""horrid"".

His contribution included revealing that Diana's mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, called her a ""whore"" for dating Muslim Hasnat Khan.

A series of spies known only by codenames such as ""X"" and ""F"" gave evidence to a courtroom cleared of the public to answer Mr al Fayed's belief that the crash was staged by MI6.

One revealed that the only mentions of Harrods in the files of MI6 referred to hampers - apparently they are very popular with James Bond.

Former spy Richard Tomlinson gave evidence about what he initially claimed had been a plot to assassinate Slobodan Milosevic through a staged car crash in a tunnel.

The claim was denied but, in one of the few genuine revelations of the inquest, MI6 witnesses confirmed a plan had indeed once been drawn up to assassinate another Balkan leader, although never implemented.

As the evidence went on the conspiracy theories grew and morphed: instead of a mystery white Fiat, there was now a suspicious blocking car.

In addition to a close network including Prince Philip and MI6, Mohamed al Fayed widened his accusations to include the CIA, Scotland Yard, Tony Blair and most of the royals - or the ""Dracula family"" - and indeed a few Spencers.

Even mild-mannered BBC reporter Peter Hunt was accused of being in MI6 when he attempted to ask Mr al Fayed a question outside court.

As he started his summing up, the coroner revealed that even Mr al Fayed's own legal team had abandoned the key conspiracy theory.

Two days before the jury retired to consider their verdict the coroner delivered what will prove to be the real verdict - there was ""not a shred of evidence"" to back up most of Mr al Fayed's claims, he said.",uncertain,training
159,"Exclusive: Inside the pub where warlord Radovan Karadzic sang nationalist songs

Welcome to war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic's local - The Madhouse... with photographs on the walls of him in his heyday as Serb leader.

Here the man they nicknamed Santa - who sat in a corner and sometimes spilled plum brandy onto his bushy beard - never revealed his true identity to the nationalist drinkers who toasted the exiled warlord night after night.

For Karadzic was leading a bizarre secret life, hiding among people who adored him as he took on the disguise of beard, glasses and a new life as alternative doctor Dragan Dabic.

Karadzic spent nearly 13 years in hiding, many of them in the Serb capital of Belgrade, where he worked in a private alternative health clinic. He also had a bogus family in America, a mistress and even appeared on TV. Criminologist Leposava Kon said: ""His new life was fascinating. He hid in the open.""

Madhouse regulars noted that beneath the heavy-rimmed glasses, Santa's eyes moved like a cobra's - no matter how drunk he seemed. Now they know that Santa was none other than Bosnian mass-murder suspect Karadzic, now facing extradition to the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

And all the time Dragan Dabic drank, his former self was always there to remind him of past glories - in the form of his portraits staring down at him from the walls of the Madhouse.

The Belgrade bar - a magnet for nationalists who share his view of Serbian glory - was a safe place for Karadzic. Often, when he was full of local brandy, he would relax a little, reach up from his little table near the bar and grab the gusle - a single-stringed instrument popular across the Balkans - off the wall.

Like some George Formby of the darkside, Karadzic would strum the gusle and sing epic stories of Serbian greatness.

Locals said he often chose a special spot to perform these solo performances, right underneath the portrait of his kindred spirit-in-crime - the still-at-large Serbian General Ratko Mladic.

Landlord Tomas Kovijanic claimed that he was fooled about Santa's true identity, along with all the other regulars. He said: ""No, I never recognised him at all, but if you look at his before and after pictures, I would say he camouflaged himself damn well. I guess it was a year ago when he first visited the restaurant. There was a musician playing the gusle and Santa got up and started to play it himself. He was pretty good.

""Gusle players sing long laments and stories about Serbian greatness - he was very good at it. And I am sure that, beneath all that hair, he was smiling at his and Mladic's pictures on the wall.

""He would come in, oh, two to three times a week. He would only drink slivovitz (plum brandy) and eat traditional dishes, and then finish up more slivovitz. He was quiet but of course he attracted a bit of attention because of the way he looked.

""And when he had had a few he would always stand the customers a few drinks. He was polite, courteous, softly spoken, never any trouble. He gave me his visiting card - not with his real name on, of course.""

After nights of drinking and singing, Santa would wobble off home to his apartment at 276 Yuri Gagarin Street, just a five-minute walk away.

His lawyer Svetozar Vujacic revealed yesterday that Karadzic, 63, requested a haircut and shave and was now looking more like his old self.

He added that his client was in good mental and physical condition. He was not talking to investigators, but ""defending himself with silence"".

The leader of the Bosnian Serbs in the 1992-5 war was arrested on a bus in Belgrade on Monday and his legal team has until tomorrow to appeal against his extradition on war crimes. But defiant Karadzic said he would be following the lead of his mentor, ex-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and would defend himself at the tribunal. Milosevic died in 2006 shortly before a verdict was due.

Karadzic has told friends and relatives that he is convinced he will be cleared of genocide charges.

He is twice indicted for genocide for the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the town of Srebrenica in 1995 and for the 43-month siege of Sarajevo. Some 11,000 people died in the city from sniper fire, mortar attacks, starvation and illness.

Karadzic had wanted Serb areas of Bosnia to be linked to Serbia and other Serb-dominated areas at a time when autocrat Milosevic was fanning nationalism in Serbia.

His wife and children are banned from leaving Bosnia under measures meant to choke off Karadzic's support network.

They are now waiting for permission to travel to Serbia. His brother Luka claimed that Karadzic had planned to surrender next January, when the Hague tribunal is due to stop launching new trials.",uncertain,test

The Weekly Standard is reporting that Vice President Dick Cheney displays in his home a chunk of the house that U.S. forces blew up to kill terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006. Beyond its obvious morbidity, the memento seems a bit unseemly in view of reports that the White House repeatedly passed on opportunities to blow up Zarqawi's house before he killed thousands of people in Iraq and elsewhere.

According to former CIA agent Michael Scheuer, the agency was closely tracking Zarqawi's activities after the 9/11 attacks and continually made known to the White House that he was in a terrorist training camp in Iraq that could be taken out: ""Almost every day we sent a package to the White House that had overhead imagery of the house he [Zarqawi] was staying in."" At the time, Scheuer was told that the White House didn't want to pull the trigger ""because they were wining and dining the French in an effort to get them to assist us in the invasion of Iraq,"" and were concerned about giving them the impression that we were ""gunslingers.""

As things turned out, we didn't get French support, we did get a damaging gunslinger reputation, and we didn't drop Zarqawi until he had already massacred thousands of people.

EU chiefs have secretly banned Britain from using the acre - one of our oldest forms of measurement.

Ministers killed it off when they put up no objection to a European Commission directive outlawing its use.

The orders were nodded through by a lowly Whitehall official - not an elected Minister - during a meeting in Brussels last week.

has seen Directive 80/181/EEC which reports: ""The Council unanimously reached political agreement on a proposal for a Directive aimed at improving the system of measurement in the EU. It abolishes the acre as a unit of land measurement in the UK.""

Shadow Europe Minister Mark Francois attacked the move last night.

He said: ""It is this kind of pointless interference into the nooks and crannies of our national life that frustrates people about the EU.

""Whether we use hectares or acres should be a matter for Britain to decide, not the EU.

""Once again this weak Labour Government has meekly given up yet another of Britain's rights to Brussels. They need to think again and insist that we must keep our right to use our ancient traditional measure of land if we wish.""

British farmers and estate agents will have to use the hectare measurement - 2.47 times the size of an acre - from January 1, 2010.

Commission chiefs ordered the move to harmonise Britain's land measurements with those of the other 26 EU member states.

The decision was buried deep in the small print of an EU document.

Britain has previously used an opt-out in measurements and is still able to use miles, yards and inches on traffic signs and speed dials for cars and other vehicles.

Pints of beer and milk have also been saved thanks to a hard-fought campaign by for imperial measurements to survive the EU bureaucrats.

But now the acre is finally being killed off.

Britain has used the acre to measure land for 700 years - with records showing it dates from the late 13th century under Edward I's reign.

On Monday's The Oprah Winfrey Show, Michael Jackson's older children speak for the first time about their late pop singer father.

Sitting down with Oprah Winfrey, Paris and Prince Michael Jackson say that never minded going out in public wearing bizarre face masks and veils. (Their grandmother Katherine Jackson tells Winfrey that the disguises were first suggested by Debbie Rowe, their biological mom.)

""When we did go out without our dad, other people wouldn't recognize us,"" Paris, 12, said. ""He tried to raise us without [us] knowing who he was, but that didn't go so well.""

Michael Jackson has become a Muslim - and changed his name to Mikaeel.

The skint superstar, 50, donned Islamic garb to pledge allegiance to the Koran in a ceremony at a pal's mansion in Los Angeles, can reveal.

Jacko sat on the floor wearing a tiny hat after an Imam was summoned to officiate - days before the singer is due to appear at London's High Court where he is being sued by an Arab sheik.

A source told last night how Jacko, brought up as a Jehovah's Witness, decided to convert as he used a studio at the home of his chum to record a new album.

The star - whose hits include The Way You Make Me Feel - was spotted looking ""a bit down"" by a producer and a songwriter who had both embraced Islam.

Shahada

The source said: ""They began talking to him about their beliefs, and how they thought they had become better people after they converted. Michael soon began warming to the idea.

""An Imam was summoned from the mosque and Michael went through the shahada, which is the Muslim declaration of belief."" Mikaeel is the name of one of Allah's angels.

""Jacko rejected an alternative name, Mustafa - meaning ""the chosen one"".

Brit singer Yousef Islam, 60 - who was called Cat Stevens until he famously converted - turned up to help Jacko celebrate.

It was his pals David Wharnsby - a Canadian songwriter - and producer Phillip Bubal who counselled Jacko.

The pair's new names are Dawud Wharnsby Ali and Idris Phillips.

Jacko now prays to Mecca after the ceremony at the Hollywood Hills home of Toto keyboard player Steve Porcaro, 51, who composed music on the singer's Thriller album.

Jacko, who rarely ventures out without a mask, is due to give evidence on Monday in a $4.7million lawsuit brought by Prince Abdulla Al-Khalif of Bahrain.

181,"Did Jacko get skin bug from nose job?

Michael Jackson is suffering from an acute MRSA-type skin infection which threatens to eat his flesh.

The singer has been receiving antibiotics via a drip in a bid to beat the superbug, which sources say has spread throughout his body.

Jacko, 50, revealed painfully-inflamed skin on his face and hands as he visited a Beverly Hills clinic where he is being treated.

The stricken pop legend may have contracted the infection following plastic surgery on his nose, it was feared last night.

The 50-year-old Billie Jean singer is said to have a severe ""staph"" infection, resistant to conventional antibiotics.

Experts warned it threatened to develop into a terrifying flesh-eating disorder which could kill off areas of the superstar's skin and leave him in need of major reconstructive surgery.

Jacko has been receiving antibiotics via an IV drip in a bid to beat the condition.

But the skin on his face and hands looked inflamed when he was snapped on his way to a Beverly Hills clinic during another week of intense treatment.

A source revealed last night: ""Michael Jackson has a severe staph infection that he contracted during work to reconstruct his nose.

""The disease is an MRSA-style infection because it is resistant to conventional antibiotics, so he has been visiting a clinic to get antibiotics via an IV drip.

""The infection has spread throughout his face and body and is being aggressively treated by doctors.

""There's a chance it could turn into a flesh-eating disorder where it begins to kill off his skin so he's being very carefully monitored.""

Swollen

Jackson was seen twice visiting the same clinic within a week.

He emerged with his face covered by dark sunglasses and a surgical mask - and with his hair hidden behind a surgical cap.

The usually-pale skin on his hands and face appeared visibly inflamed with red and purple blotches and he appeared to have a severely swollen cheek.

US celebrity plastic surgeon Dr Anthony Youn, who has not treated Jacko but has viewed the shocking photos of the star, said: ""It is possible that Mr Jackson has a staph infection or MRSA.

""This is called a 'super-infection' because it is resistant to conventional antibiotics. It does look like his skin is red and inflamed and has become infected.

""Staph infection or MRSA is extremely worrying because it is an aggressive infection that is resistant to most conventional antibiotics.

""In some worse cases surgeons will have to remove the infected tissue if it dies - leaving the patient needing major reconstructive surgery. It is particularly worrying if it is on the face.""

Dr Youn, who runs The Hills Plastic Surgery and Laser Centre and is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said: ""Many people in the health-care system can contract this disease via cuts to the skin.

""But it is possible Mr Jackson contracted it through surgery on his nose. There are occasions where patients contract the infection during plastic surgery procedures.

""Doctors try to treat the infection early with antibiotics administered via IV drip - and in many cases the patient can make a good recovery if it is caught early enough.""

Jackson's increasingly frail appearance has prompted speculation about the state of his health.

Last month Ian Halperin, author of a Jackson biography, claimed the singer was suffering from potentially fatal lung disease. But Jackson's spokesman dismissed this as a ""total fabrication"".

He added: ""Mr Jackson is in fine health, and finalising negotiations with a major entertainment company and television network for both a world tour and a series of specials and appearances.""

The spokesman refused to return calls last night.

Jackson has always insisted he suffers from a skin condition called vitiligo, a chronic skin disease which causes loss of pigment.

Despite the dramatic changes to his appearance, he admits only to having two minor cosmetic procedures. He has admitted to minor work on his nose to help him breathe.

Last summer, the star was seen being pushed in a wheelchair as he approached his 50th birthday. The gaunt singer was clad in pyjamas and slippers.

182,"Michael Jackson wanted to clone himself

Michael Jackson was so terrified of dying he was desperate to clone himself in a bizarre bid to extend his superstar legacy.

Jackson - who was obsessed with the idea of immortality - attended a Las Vegas conference on human cloning with his friend, the spoon bender Uri Geller.

And the King of Pop was so blown away by the teachings of a sect called the Raelians he asked if they would clone him.

Jacko's chauffeur Al Bowman, who drove the singer and Geller to the event in 2002, said: ""Jackson was very excited.

""He bounced out of that conference like a small child. He was smiling and on a high. I heard him and Uri talking in the back of the limo.

""He was talking about the prospect of being cloned. He grabbed Uri by both arms and told him, ""I really want to do it Uri,  and I don't care how much it costs"".""

The Raelian movement is a strange religious sect that believes the human soul dies when the body dies so the key to eternal life is cloning - recreating individuals from their own genetic make-up.

The sect also has a scientific arm called Clonaid which holds regular fund-raising events to share its latest research with the great and good of Hollywood.

""I always remember Jackson talking about the cloning of Dolly the sheep in Britain in 1996 - he was totally fascinated by it,"" said Al, 50, Jacko's chauffeur for over a decade.

""Then when he heard about the Raelians he became utterly convinced this weird religious group could clone humans.

""It was really oddball stuff, but it interested Michael. One day in the limo he said, ""They did it with Dolly"". I said, ""Dali? you mean Salvador Dali"". We both laughed.

""Michael said he wanted a mini-version of himself cloned to carry on his legacy. He was hoping that Michael Jackson could live for ever.""

In the 90s Jackson inquired about being cryogenically frozen before he died and it  was also rumoured that he took GH3, a drug designed to prolong life expectancy.

But he was particularly fascinated by the Raelians,  which were founded by French journalist Claude Vorilhon.

In December 1973, Vorilhon - or Rael as he is now known - claimed he was contacted by an extra-terrestrial being who emerged from a flying saucer and told him - in fluent French - that humans were created in laboratories 25,000 years ago by people from another planet .

This race of super-intelligent beings was called the Elohim, which in ancient Hebrew means ""those who came from the sky"" and in Jewish prayers refers to God.

Rael describes the Elohim as being ""about a metre tall, with pale green skin and long dark hair"".

Some estimates suggest that the Raelian movement now has up to 55,000 members, who are all preparing for the expected return of the Elohim to Earth.

Al, who was once given a cat by Jackson who then insisted on dressing it himself, said: ""I used to drive so many celebrities around LA, and so many of them became obsessed with these weird religious sects - Michael was no different.

People in Hollywood are the most creative people you'll ever meet, but they're also the most stupid people around. They believe almost anything and then they hand over all their millions to these groups.""

It's believed Jacko made contact with the Raelians after the conference in Las Vegas and spoke with Dr Brigette Boisselier about the idea of a Jacko clone.

Dr Boisselier, a trained scientist with a master's degree in biochemistry and a doctorate in physical chemistry, is also a Raelian bishop and the managing director of Clonaid, which was set up in the Bahamas in 1997. In December 2002 she told the world that the Raelians had created the first cloned child - a baby girl named Eve.

She popped up on American, French, British and Belgian TV promising that a second cloned baby would soon be born to a lesbian couple in an undisclosed northern European location.

There has been no evidence of any such baby but the following year, in 2003, Al said he got a call from one of Jacko's publicists. ""I wasn't chauffeuring for Michael anymore, but then this woman calls me out of the blue saying she was his publicist,"" said Al.

""She wanted contact details for the Raelian people. She said Michael was furious with them and she needed to get hold of them. She wouldn't say why.

""I thought that surely Michael or one of his people had a contact number, but the woman said he'd lost it. I gave them a number and then didn't hear anything back.""

It remains unclear whether Jacko ever pursued his cloning ambition any further.

On its website, Clonaid advertises human cloning services for $200,000 and egg services for infertile women starting at $5,000.

It says: ""Eve, the first cloned baby, was born on December 26, 2002, thanks to our team of highly skilled scientists. Since then, we've been able to help a number of patients have their own children through our cloning technology.""

Last night the Daily Mirror was unable to speak to anyone from Clonaid.

But Al, who now organises music events in Phoenix, Arizona, said: ""When I heard Clonaid had cloned the first human being, I couldn't help thinking there was a mini Michael Jackson running around somewhere. With Michael, anything is possible.""",uncertain,test
183,"Michael Jackson's abuse case drove him to brink of suicide

Michael Jackson was a suicidal wreck during his child abuse trial - fearing he would be thrown in jail, his former lawyer has revealed.

Defence attorney Tony Capozzola says a fragile Jacko spent hours on the phone sobbing that he was terrified about spending time behind bars under constant fear of attack from fellow inmates.

The star was also worried that his children would be left alone if he was convicted of molesting 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo in the 2005 trial.

In his first interview about the case, Capozzola revealed Jacko hated his nickname ""Wacko Jacko"" and failed to understand why people thought it sick that he shared his bed with young boys.

Capozzola, 68, who runs a legal practice in Redondo Beach, California, said: ""Michael was terrified that he might be convicted and go to jail - that was his worst fear.

""He called me many, many times after court, he called me late at night.

""He was very emotional and crying in a lot of the calls, it was a really tough time for him, he was unstable.

""Our relationship developed into a friendship and if I wasn't there, he spoke to my wife. Michael was frightened to be in custody, he knew that if he went to prison as a child molester, terrible things would have happened to him.

""He was scared he would be attacked and even molested by other prisoners.

""Physically he was very frail and very frightened about that.""

Capozzola had been asked by Michael to oversee his defence during the trial to make sure it ran smoothly. The case was triggered by a British documentary film, presented by the journalist Martin Bashir, in which the singer admitted sharing his bed with young boys at his Neverland ranch in California.

Jackson insisted there was no sexual contact and that it was a ""beautiful thing"", ""charming"" and ""sweet"".

However, Arvizo went on to accuse Jackson of sexually abusing him and the singer was charged with 10 counts, including four of molesting a minor.

He denied all charges and claimed he was the victim of a failed extortion attempt. But it came after being accused of abusing 13-year-old Jordan Chandler.

While Michael settled those 1993 claims with a $10million payment, nothing could stop the Arvizo case going to court.

All Capozzola could do was try his best to reassure the King of Pop and constantly tell him the trial was going well and he wasn't going to jail.

During five months of stressful court appearances, Jacko battled a roller-coaster of emotions that could easily have led to the star killing himself.

Capozzola said: ""He would constantly say, ""Tony do you think I'm going to jail? I need you to be honest with me."" ""He would break down, his voice would tremble and he'd be sobbing. He never said I'm going to kill myself, but he said I can't go to jail, I just can't. He implied that he would have to find another way out.

""I tried everything to keep his mind away from that, but I was worried he would do something stupid. In court, Michael was completely quiet, the perfect defendant. He wasn't arrogant, he didn't say a word. He just sat there frightened.

""They said all these terrible things about him. Michael was upset, even sick.""

Jackson also believed Judge Rodney Melville had it in for him. ""He thought the judge hated him, the judge seemed to threaten him all the time,"" said Capozzola.

In one bizarre appearance at Santa Maria court, Jackson arrived in his pyjamas. Capozzola said: ""He was ill and frightened, which made him look weirder.""

And still the pop star didn't grasp why there was such public outcry over his behaviour with children.

""He could not understand society's evil thoughts about him because of his mental set, he was Peter Pan, ""Why do they think I'm evil,"" he'd say. ""I don't know why everyone thinks I'm guilty."" I had to be very blunt with him, I told him, ""Because you're a 48-year-old man and you got interviewed by Martin Bashir and told him you sleep with children.

That doesn't go on in America or in most civilised countries, a man does not sleep with children."" ""Michael told me nothing sexual went on and I believed him.

But I said again that sleeping with kids doesn't go in today's society, but he told me, 'That's society's problem and not mine'. In other words they are the dirty old men.""

The lawyer recalls how Jackson hit rockbottom in the final days of the trial.

He said: ""The night before the jury went out Michael hit an all-time low. His voice was trembling and he said, ""I'm very worried, I'm very worried."" His biggest concern was his children.

""He said, ""If I go to jail, I don't know what will happen to my family, who will look after them?"""" During the trial Capozzola went on the attack and is credited with getting Michael cleared. He started investigating Gavin Arvizo's mother Janet and believed she was trying to extort money from Michael.

He said: ""I discovered she had committed welfare fraud, and once the jury heard about this, they held that thought throughout the trial, they believed she was a fraud, and she was a key witness.

""Michael Jackson was never an evil person, but he was certainly a target for those who are.""

Quincy: His death is still too surreal

Legendary music producer Quincy Jones yesterday said he never believed in his ""wildest nightmares"" that Michael Jackson would die before him.

Quincy, 76, who worked with Jacko on his early albums, added: ""I still don't know how to process it. It's too surrealistic for me. I was 50 years of age when I produced Thriller, his age.

""We had so many experiences together, it's hard to believe.""

Quincy, right, said Michael was like a little brother but he would not attend his funeral. He added: ""There's a lump down here, so deep with emotions. I don't go to any funerals and I won't be going to Michael's.

I've lost 150 friends in twoand-a-half years. That's a lot to deal with. It's so unreal that Michael has gone. I can't believe it. It's like a bad movie.""

Quincy, who is a quarter Welsh, was made a fellow of the Welsh College of Music and Drama yesterday.

In a question and answer session with students, he said: ""Michael's like a part of my soul. I can't help it, that's the way it is. He's my little brother that's gone.

""He was the very best. People ask me if he was crazy. All artists are crazy. You don't want the boy next door.""

How he died affects $10m cover on gigs

Organisers Michael Jackson's cancelled London concerts could lose a $10million insurance payment if it is found the singer died of natural causes.

A Lloyds policy taken on Jacko's life by promoters AEG Live will pay out only if the star's death was accidental - including a drugs overdose.

Boss Randy Phillips, below, said that would fall short of between $15million and $18million the firm had spent on Jackson's advance and other costs.

But he added that around half of those who had paid for seats had opted to receive their tickets as memorabilia instead of a full refund - a move that will help the company break even.

The sold-out O2 concerts generated $52million in ticket sales, but AEG has offered full refunds on the face value and surcharges.

Cash from rehearsal concert footage and a video project Jackson was overseeing could also help balance books.

Phillips said: ""For the record, this great company I work for is not bankrupt and not going out of business and certainly not in trouble. I'm heartbroken but the company's fine.""

""Flying from Nassau, Bahamas 2 NY. TSA ""random selects"" my 5 month old daughter 4 a pat down,"" he wrote Monday, Jan. 27. ""I am not kidding,"" the disgruntled actor tweeted along with the hashtag, ""#travelinginUSisadisgrace.""

But the Blue Jasmine star, 55, apparently muddled a few facts in his social media state of fury. A senior Homeland Security official told NBC News Tuesday that the TSA neither screens passengers in the Bahamas nor pats down any child under the age of 12. Also, the Bahamas is not a U.S. territory -- the cluster of tropical islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean, actually comprise its own nation.

One Twitter user actually pointed out these facts to the actor, who then responded, ""So, I guess there is a TSA-like function as you go through US customs in Nassau. But you sophisticate, you! You got me,"" he wrote.

The security hiccup, however, did not affect the family's trek home: The actor's yoga instructor wife, 29, took to the aisles of first class to stretch into a balanced Warrior III pose (also commonly referred to as ""airplane"" by yogis).

""I'm sorry,"" she captioned the shot as confused passengers stared at Hilaria. ""You've never seen airplane pose at 35,000 feet? #yogapostureoftheday #hilariaypd thank you to all my fellow passenger yoga buddies!""",uncertain,test

Having to empty pockets of loose change and shedding coats, belts and shoes at airport security checkpoints can be one of the most annoying aspects of going on holiday.

Al-Qaeda is training kids as young as 10 to kidnap and kill, it has chillingly been claimed.

The US military said videos seized from suspected al-Qaeda in Iraq hideouts show militants training children who appear as young as 10.

It is viewed as a sign that the terror network - hungry for recruits - may be using younger Iraqis in propaganda to lure a new crop of fighters.

""Al-Qaeda in Iraq wants to poison the next generation of Iraqis,"" said US military spokesman Rear Adm. Gregory Smith.

""It is offering children as the new generation of mujahedeen,"" he added, using the Arabic term for holy warriors.

The video, shown to reporters yesterday, depicted an apparent training session with black-masked boys - ammunition belts draped across their small chests - forcing a man off his bicycle at gunpoint and marching him off down a muddy lane.

An off-camera voice, speaking with an Iraqi accent, instructs children how to take firing positions with assault rifles.

At one point, the boys huddle in a circle on a cement floor, solemnly pledging allegiance to al-Qaeda.

US and Iraqi officials said they could offer no estimate of how many children have joined the insurgency.

Young children are rarely behind insurgent attacks in Iraq, though they have been used as decoys.

In March, police said children were used in a car bombing in which the driver gained permission to park in a busy shopping area after pointing out that he was leaving his kids in the back seat.

The children were killed along with three Iraqi bystanders.

The military said the videos - seized in a December raid in Khan Bani Saad northeast of Baghdad - were filmed in Iraq and depicted Iraqi children, but offered no definitive evidence.

The depraved sites are password-protected and encrypt data so perverts can conceal sick pictures and messages from police.

A security source said: ""Using child pornography sites appears to be al-Qaeda's latest desperate attempt to avoid detection.

""Sadly, the high levels of secrecy, passwords and encryption demanded by paedophiles means their websites can offer good cover for terrorists.""

A solicitor who specialises in defending al-Qaeda terrorists saw her firm take $1.6million in Legal Aid payments in just two years.

Mudassar Arani was accused by a judge of trying ""cynically to manipulate"" the trial process in the case of the failed July 21 bombers.

She was also filmed sharing a stage with hate cleric Omar Bakri's associate Anjem Choudary in 2007.

In footage which appeared on an extremist website she said: ""My destiny is not controlled by no judge, no Law Society. My destiny is controlled by Allah.""

Figures obtained by the Mirror under the Freedom of Information Act reveal her firm Arani and Co, based in London, was paid $770,091 in Legal Aid during the financial year 2006 to 2007.

The following year she received another $890,813 from the Legal Services Commission, though that may be for previous years' work.

In seven years Arani and Co has taken $3.5million from Legal Aid. Its income quadrupled since 2001 to 2002, when it received $230,314.

Last month the Mirror revealed the trial of Dhiren Barot and his gang cost the taxpayer more than $5million.

The terror leader and seven henchmen were jailed for a total of 166 years over plans for mass murder.

Barot schemed how to detonate bombs on the Heathrow Express and under the Thames and to target iconic buildings in the US.

Ugandan-born Arani represented him and her firm earned hundreds of thousands of pounds from his trial. At a rally filmed last year she passed a message from Barot, saying: ""No matter what they do to me I will remain strong.""

During the July 21 bomb plot trial last year, Arani, 45, represented the ringleader Mukhtar Ibrahim and two of his accomplices.

Arani has taken up the case of Abu Hamza and claimed jailed fanatics should be treated like ""prisoners of war"".

227,"Exclusive: billion dollar bunker

America is to spend $1billion on an embassy in Baghdad ""more secure than the Pentagon"".

Plans for the hi-tech complex are being kept secret because of the terrorist threat in Iraq.

The exact location is not being released until later this year but it is likely to be built in the heavily fortified Green Zone area where the Iraqi government and US military command is based.

The embassy will be guarded by 15ft blast walls and ground-to-air missiles and the main building will have bunkers for use during air offensives.

The grounds will include as many as 300 houses for consular and military officials.

And a large-scale barracks will be built for Marines who will protect what will be Washington's biggest and most secure overseas building.

A US source in the Middle East said last night: ""Plans for the embassy building are being kept behind closed doors because of the terrorist threat.

""It will be more secure than The Pentagon because it will be under constant threat from attack."" The Green Zone is the safest part of Baghdad, surrounded by concrete blast walls and checkpoints.

The US also wants to build four massive military superbases around Iraq's capital.

The plans will fuel speculation they want to keep a firm foothold in Iraq for many years.

An Iraqi security source said last night: ""The plans for the embassy building will make it the largest and best protected diplomatic building overseas for the US.

""You may as well move the Pentagon to Iraq. It will be amazingly secure but it also flies in the face of claims American is preparing to leave Iraq to be policed and governed by Iraqis.

""Plans for four superbases across the country will only reinforce the view that the US is here to stay for the duration.""

The move comes despite Donald Rumsfeld revealing last week that US troop numbers in Iraq are to be reduced by 7,000 to 153,000.

Tony Blair has also predicted British troops could start pulling out this May.

Backing among the American public for President Bush's action in Iraq has fallen. Despite the opposition a Kuwait-based construction company has already been handed $175million ($300 million) of the building deal.

Plans for four huge military bases placed strategically around Baghdad are also being drawn up.

The superbases will be in central Iraq, close to the capital, and also to the north, west and east of Baghdad.

Several other Middle Eastern and American building firms are tendering for the remaining budget.

Funding will probably come from Iraqi oil revenues channelled into redeveloping the country.

America has a string of 'secret' military bases throughout the Gulf states, including Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.

229,"Pope pets Oz animals

Pope Benedict XVI cuddled a koala and met a host of other Aussie animals on the second day of the World Youth Day celebrations.

The pope, enjoying a final day of rest before joining in the festival's events on Thursday, held prayers at a private retreat, then viewed some native Australian animals brought to him by wildlife officers - including a kangaroo, a baby crocodile and a spiky echidna.

He happily petted a koala, scratching it briefly behind the ear.

World Youth Day, which is organised by the Catholic Church, is the largest youth event in the world.

The second day began with ""time for silence for reflection,"" according to the pilgrims' official handbook.

While afternoon events include a pilgrimage walk to the downtown St Mary's Cathedral and a party at Sydney's famous Bondi Beach - featuring a rapping American priest.

Young Roman Catholic pilgrims were also able to attend religious classes before tucking into sausages at barbecues at hundreds of venues around the city.

Pilgrims also received the second of daily mobile phone text messages from Pope Benedict, which read: ""The Holy Spirit gave the Apostles and gives u the power boldly 2 proclaim that Christ is risen! - BXVI.""

Nearly 250,000 people registered for World Youth Day, more than half from overseas. The scale of the event was revealed when pilgrims arrived in droves and gathered along the waterfront yesterday near the landmark Sydney Harbour Bridge for a twilight Mass, beginning with a procession of groups from 168 countries waving their national flags.

Pope Benedict has been resting at a retreat on Sydney's outskirts. He is to move to the grounds of St Mary's Cathedral, an imposing gothic-style church that is one of Australia's oldest and largest, later today, marking the end of his semi-vacation.

On Thursday, he will receive a traditional Aboriginal welcome and tour Sydney's harbour by boat before delivering a major address to pilgrims.

A papal Mass on Sunday before thousands at a racetrack in the city is scheduled to end the proceedings.

In his sermon at the official opening Mass on Tuesday, Sydney's Archbishop Cardinal George Pell, urged the pilgrims to keep the faith through self-discipline and prayer.

""Many of you have travelled such a long way that you may believe that you have arrived indeed at the ends of the Earth,"" the Archbishop said.

""If so, that's good, for our Lord told his first apostles that they would be his witnesses in Jerusalem and to the ends of the Earth.""

Rites, including the Holy Communion, left many in tears.

Some in the crowd sang along with the choir and orchestra as they played traditional hymns and more upbeat Christian pop songs.

The pilgrims who are staying in churches, schools and volunteers' homes have filled the city for days, recognizable by their official yellow, red and orange backpacks and their cheerful greetings and outbursts of song.

Yesterday, comforted by neighbours, she recalled their 71-year friendship.

Halina said: ""We called him Lolek and although his hobby was football, he was different from the other boys.

She became an actress as she had dreamed, but Karol joined the priesthood.

Years afterwards, she watched on TV as he was made Pope.

Later Halina went to the Vatican with a party from Poland and called out to the Pope. There was no reaction.

But as she left, a Mercedes pulled up. The driver said: ""Jump in. I have orders to bring you to the Holy Father. He wants to eat breakfast with you.""

A woman jumped the barriers in St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican and knocked down Pope Benedict XVI as he walked down the main aisle to begin Christmas Eve Mass tonight, a Vatican spokesman said.

The Rev Ciro Benedettini said the Pope quickly got up and was unhurt.

Benedict calmly resumed his walk to the basilica's main altar and began the Mass.

Benedettini said the woman who pushed the Pope appeared to be mentally unstable and had been arrested by Vatican police.

She also knocked down Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, who was taken to hospital for a check-up, Benedettini said.

The 82-year-old Pope quickly got up and was unhurt, his spokesman said.

As the Pope's procession was making its way towards the main altar gasps rang out through the public and a commotion could be seen among the clergymen surrounding Benedict.

The procession came to a halt and bodyguards rushed to the trouble spot.

Benedict made no reference to the incident as the service started. As a choir sang, he sprinkled incense on the main altar before opening the service with the traditional wish for peace in Latin: ""Pax vobis"" (""Peace be with you"").

The faithful responded: ""Et cum spiritu tuo"" (""And also with you"").

It was the second year in a row there was a security breach at the service.

Investigators are probing possible links in the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard in 1991 and the disappearance of Misheloff who went missing close to her school in Dublin, California in 1989 when she was 13.

""The police have spoken to my parents Mike and Maddi about the case but we want them to comment on the investigation. There are similarities and we have never given-up hope of finding Ilene who went missing over 20 years ago now,"" Brian Miselhoff, 34, said.

Police are also looking into the abduction of Michaela Garecht in 1988 who disappeared from Hayward, California, when she was 9.

""We are delighted that Jaycee has been re-united with her family because it is unimaginably painful experience to go through what we and many others have endured,"" he added. ""For me the Garrido's are the most horrible people imaginable and I don't know what I would say to them if we ever came face to face - but I hope they are helping the investigators if they know anything about Ilene and the other girl Michaela Garecht who went missing around the same time.""

""Ilene and I would argue and fight a lot when we were growing-up but she was the closest friend I had,"" he revealed. ""She would never have done anything to hurt anybody but was very driven too and her great passion was ice-skating. It's been so difficult for my family since she went missing and especially for my parents who have been married for 38 years.""

A paedophile cop was jailed for two-and-a-half years yesterday after being caught when a colleague posed online as a girl aged 12.

Married David Geering, 48, had been a detective with the Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Serious Crime Command.

But all the time he was a child sex pervert trading hundreds of vile images with other sickos.

A number of photos featured the most extreme kind of child abuse.

Geering was found to have taken indecent photos of two kids himself.

He used the false name Nigel Robotham to cover his tracks but was nabbed when he made internet contact with someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl.

It was actually a fake identity assumed by officers from the Met Police Paedophile Unit.

Three of his computers were traced to an internet cafe in London's Victoria district, an address in Hertfordshire and a property in Spain.

Checks with other forces revealed Geering's evil trade in images of kids.

Geering was jailed at London's Southwark Crown Court on 20 counts of distributing indecent images of children and two counts of taking indecent images of children.

""I have always found that the way to deal with racism -- and I can assure you that no one had to suffer from it more than I did -- is from the inside.""

But he admitted that the Met BPA may have good grounds to make its call, revealed in The Sun yesterday.

""Buttons were ripped off my uniform and I had cups of tea and bananas thrown at me and my sergeant called me n*****.

Model Naomi Campbell is facing a ban from flying with British Airways.

Crazed Naomi yesterday flew into a rage over one lost bag -- after 20,000 pieces of luggage went missing at Heathrow's trouble-hit Terminal 5.

The model, 37, allegedly spat at a cop who was called to calm her down -- then laid into him with her fists.

She was arrested on the spot for assaulting an officer, then restrained after a struggle and hauled kicking and screaming off the plane in handcuffs.

The airline today said the question of whether Naomi would be allowed to fly with the airline again was ""under review"".

She was released on bail this morning. At 1am her press agent, Celena Aponte gave a statement outside the police station, saying: ""She arrived in plenty of time at Heathrow Terminal 5 with two bags, checked them in, and told they were take the flight.

""Once on the flight, she was told one bag could not be found and was missing.

""British Airways decided to resolve this by insisting she leave the flight, calling the police, and forcibly ejected her from the flight.

""So far as we are aware, BA has still failed to offer any explanation as to why her bag went missing at Terminal 5.""

Ms Aponte said Miss Campbell was flying to LA to attend a memorial service of the mother of fashion photographer Herb Britts.

Yelling

Ms Aponte added she did not know Campbell's plans for today and whether she still intended to fly to the US.

Asked how Naomi had behaved, she said: ""I can not comment further.""

The supermodel -- who paid $6,000 for the flight -- had screamed insults at airline workers. She was still yelling abuse at the steward who took boarding cards as she took a seat on the plane yesterday evening.

Staff called police and three officers from the Met's SO18 aviation security branch arrived.

A police escort van took her to Heathrow police station. Her fingerprints were taken along with a DNA swab and photograph.

Her other bag was offloaded from flight BA 269 -- delaying other passengers on the plane by 90 minutes.

One police source said of the incident: ""She was going nuts, spitting, punching and lashing out. BA staff were genuinely concerned about her well-being.

""They had no alternative but to call police when she refused to calm down.

""The police adopted a softly softly approach but she still went into a frenzy. They had no choice but to arrest her for the assault of a police officer.""

A witness who saw her tantrum in the first-class lounge said: ""She was screaming, ""Get off, get off, don't touch me -- leave me alone"".""

Terminal 5 has been in chaos ever since it opened on Thursday last week -- with hundreds of flights cancelled and thousands of bags going missing.

But Naomi appears to be the only one of 280,000 passengers so far who required cops to be summoned.

A British Airports Authority spokeswoman said yesterday: ""We are unaware of any other incident, apart from this, where police have had to be called in.""

Yesterday a police spokesman said: ""We can confirm that at 17.13pm police were called to a disturbance at Terminal 5, Heathrow. A 37-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer.""

British Airways declined to comment.

Naomi could be jailed for up to six months if she is charged with assaulting a police officer under new guidelines published in February.

This morning Naomi, wearing a leather jacket, grey baseball cap and large black sunglasses, walked through a gaggle of press into a waiting Range Rover Sport after leaving the police station.

Rapist cop Adam Carruthers lost his battle to keep his full police pension yesterday.

The 46-year-old beast sued Dumfries and Galloway Council when his $18,000-a-year payout was cut by 65 per cent after his conviction.

Vile Carruthers -- jailed for raping two women while in uniform -- claimed the reduction breached his human rights.

But yesterday a sheriff rejected the monster's claims following a three-day inquiry earlier.

In a written judgement, Sheriff Kenneth Ross said: ""The offences were liable to lead to a serious loss of confidence in the public service.

""The latter is very important in my opinion. It is an unchallenged fact.""

Dozens of furious friends and family of Carruthers' victims protested outside Dumfries Sheriff Court during the inquiry in June.

The dad-of-two was caged in 2001 for raping the women while serving as a cop in Langholm, Dumfriesshire.

Another 38 women later claimed the beast had raped, attacked or harassed them during his 20-year career.

He was freed from his 11-year sentence last year and attempted to recoup his pension shortfall.

He claimed the forfeiture was illegal as he had paid his debt to society.

Sheriff Ross dismissed his case but ruled any pension for his widow or children should be unaffected.

Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was pleased at the ruling.

A spokesman added: ""We hope Carruthers' victims will see this judgment as a positive reaction to the suffering they were caused by his offences.

282,"British millionaire Andreas Liveras among the 130 killed by terrorists in Mumbai attack on Westerners

A Brit tycoon was fatally gunned down in the Mumbai massacre moments after telling the world of the terror, it emerged last night.

Yacht millionaire Andreas Liveras, 73, was among hundreds of guests who cowered in fright in a building as armed fanatics went on the rampage outside.

He told the BBC by phone: ""There must be more than 1,000 people here. All we know is the bombs are next door and the hotel is shaking every time a bomb goes off. Everybody is living on their nerves.""

Mr Liveras is thought to have been shot shortly afterwards.

Last night the death toll rose to 130 as the first gruesome pictures emerged of holidaymakers slain in the bloodbath.

More than seven Brits were thought to be among more than 300 people injured.

British High Commissioner Sir Richard Stagg said he had seen up to four wounded Britons in hospital but warned the total ""must be significantly more"".

Southampton lawyer Tasneem Jeevanjee, 42, told how she feared she would die after terrorists locked her and four other hostages in a smoke-filled room in the burning Taj Mahal Palace hotel.

Her mum Sara said: ""She couldn't breathe. She told us that at that point she was seconds from death. She lay down on the floor to die. She thought that was it.

""Luckily one man managed to break a window. The room happened to be by a road and they managed to escape.""

Gun battles continued yesterday between Indian commandos and terror gangs holed up in the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Oberoi-Trident hotels and in the HQ of an ultra-orthodox Jewish group.

Armed forces repeatedly brought hostages and corpses from the hotels and seven were freed from the Jewish centre.

Commandos were last night still waging room-to-room battles to flush the fanatics out of the hotels, with 200 guests still feared trapped.

Meanwhile, a terrifying picture of the massacre emerged from Brits - including ready meals tycoon Sir Gulam Noon - who were trapped in the horror as 25 fanatics attacked seven packed sites in Mumbai.

Mr Liveras, of Nottingham, who had a $315million fortune, was visiting the Taj Mahal Palace for a meal when shooting started on Wednesday night.

He had said: ""As soon as we sat at the table we heard machine gun fire in the corridor. We hid under the table and then they switched all the lights off.

""But the machine guns kept going and they took us into the kitchen, and from there into a basement, before we came up into a salon where we are now. The doors are locked and we are inside.

""Hotel staff are helping us a lot, providing water and sandwiches, but nobody is eating. People are frightened. At this moment it's very quiet. The last bomb exploded about 45 minutes ago and it shook the hotel.""

The tycoon is believed to have been shot several times just minutes later.

Holidaymaker Diane Murphy, shot in the foot, told how she cradled husband Michael as he lost consciousness after a bullet hit him in the ribs

The retired teachers, from near Hexham in Northumberland, had been in Mumbai for just one day when the fanatics stormed the packed Leopold Cafe.

Diane, 58, said: ""All of a sudden there was automatic gunfire. My husband and I were hit, as were lots of people. Everybody was down on the ground. The gunfire stopped for a few seconds then started again.

""I stayed with my husband because I could tell he was seriously injured. He was losing consciousness.""

Michael, 59, had his spleen removed and is in intensive care. Sir Gulam, 72, was in his room at the Taj Mahal Palace when a blast rocked the building.

He said: ""I was about to run outside but I looked through the peephole and saw a man with an AK47 coming down the corridor.""

He rang the duty manager who warned him to blockade his door as the gunmen were hunting Brits and Americans.

He added: ""We saw two terrorists on our floor and heard gunfire just outside our room.

It was a very frightening experience.""

Tory MEP Sajjad Karim fled as gunmen burst into the hotel. He said: ""There were about 17 or 18 of us and another gunman appeared.

""He had an automatic machine gun type of weapon, pointed it straight at us and started firing.

""People in front and to the side of me started to fall and about three or four of us managed to get away.""

There was similar chaos when gunmen burst into the Oberoi-Trident and ordered 40 people upstairs. Alex Chamberlain, who was in the hotel restaurant, said: ""They told everybody put their hands up and asked if there were any British or Americans.

""My friend said to me, ""Don't be a hero, don't say you're British"".""

Last night 14 policemen and five terrorists lay dead after the carnage. Another 11 of the gang were in custody.

World leaders were united in their condemnation. Gordon Brown said: ""This is a loss of innocent lives, people just going about their daily business. We've got to do everything we can to help."" British police, security officers, Foreign Office personnel and Red Cross staff have flown to Mumbai.

283,"Sri Lanka terror attack hero Chris Broad tells cricketer son Stuart: It was the worst moment of my life, I was scared out of my wits

Terror attack survivor Chris Broad suffered 'the worst moment of his life' as he dived for cover under a hail of bullets in Lahore.

His son, England bowler Stuart Broad said: ""Dad saw things that he never expected to see - and he never wants to see again.""

Broad, a former England opening batsman and now an International Cricket Council match referee, threw himself on top of a local umpire when they too came under fire in the terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Pakistan. The driver of Broad's car was killed and another passenger shot.

Pakistan umpire Ahsan Raza was also hit by gunfire and Broad bravely shielded him from further bullets.

Broad revealed: ""If I have to go throught it time and again it just brings back ugly memories. I saw some horrific things.""

He described the full horror of the incident to his son, who is currently touring the West Indies with the England team.

In a 20-minute nightmare, Broad was caught up in a scene resembling a war zone, before being rescued and driven to safety by a police officer once the gunfire had ceased.

He immediately tried to contact Stuart out in Barbados to let him know he was OK, but had to wait fully an hour before being able to speak to his loved ones and reassure them. The 51-year-old then told his son he was shocked and shaken by the whole ordeal, but considered himself lucky to have escaped unharmed by the attack.

Stuart Broad said: ""I got a call last night at around 1am, but I missed the call and thought 'what's going on here?'

""I saw on the news that an incident had happened, so I got straight back on the phone trying to get hold of Dad.

""Luckily, I got through at about 2am and he was a bit shaken and stirred up - but thankfully he's OK. He said he was in the car and watched his driver get killed. Two other people in the car were also shot, so he lay low while the mayhem happened.

""He was sitting behind the driver and as soon as it all started he dived on to the floor and just tried to keep down while the other two guys in the car were shot trying to do the same.

""It was one of those vans where you could lie down between the seats in the aisle, and he was lucky not to have been shot. He said the police fought off the attackers and once the mayhem died down he got driven to safety. He was in the match officials' car with a liaison officer and the fourth umpire, who got shot.

""Dad was very lucky. He said it was the worst moment of his life. He was scared out of his wits.""

Broad was on his way to the third day's play between Pakistan and Sri Lanka as ICC match referee when his vehicle came under fire.

Tucked right behind the Sri Lanka bus, which was also riddled with bullets, Broad admitted to his son that it was incredible that more people were not killed.

Stuart Broad added: ""He is obviously distraught that some people lost their lives in the incident, but he accepts it is lucky that more lives weren't lost. I'm not planning on going home early to see him, he's all right although a little bit shocked.

""He's shook up, but really he's fine and he can see the bigger picture that more lives weren't lost. Dad got flown out by helicopter to Abu Dhabi and is then heading straight home. I'll see him as soon as I get back.""

Fellow Brit Paul Farbrace (left), Sri Lanka's assistant coach, was caught in the crossfire and had shrapnel removed from his arm.

The ex-Middlesex and Kent stumper said: ""It was very frightening. That panic when you lie on the floor hearing gunfire and you can hear the bus being hit, you just pray one of them doesn't hit you.

""I am just very grateful I am still alive. I look back on the situation and feel desperately sad for the people who died trying to protect us."" Farbrace described how he heard the windows of the bus breaking and got down to the floor.

""It is then you realise you are a sitting duck,"" he said.

Speaking about security preparations, he added: ""We had a meeting when we were told we would be coming and asked for a few things to be put in place.

""I don't think anyone would send a cricket team anywhere if there was any question about their safety.""",uncertain,test
284,"Thai ""yellow shirt"" leader shot in head but cheats assasination atttempt

The leader of Thailand's yellow shirt protest movement escaped an attempt on his life yesterday in which assassins sprayed his car with more than 100 bullets.

Sondhi Limthongkul, whose People's Alliance For Democracy ousted ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, was hit in the skull in an ambush by gunmen using AK-47s and M-16s in the capital Bangkok.

Last night, Mr Sondhi was said to be in a stable condition following surgery.

His driver was in a serious condition, while an aide suffered minor injuries in the attack - which came as Mr Sondhi travelled to record a show at his TV station.

A local police commander said: ""At least two attackers followed Sondhi's car, overtook it and sprayed it with about 100 rounds of gunfire from AK-47 and M-16s."" It was unclear who was behind the assassination attempt.

Thousands of rival red shirt demonstrators have paralysed the Thai capital in increasingly violent protests in the past week. Two people died and more than 100 were injured as they took to the streets demanding that current Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva step down.

It is feared the attack will fuel tensions between the red and yellow factions.

Media mogul and businessman Mr Sondhi has many enemies among the red shirts, but also in the police, army and the current government.

285,"Mumbai attack: British witness tells of frantic escape from gunmen

A British witness to the terrorist attack in Mumbai today described how he ""frantically"" tried to escape gunmen after they stormed his hotel.

Alan Jones from South Wales told BBC News that he was in a lift in the lobby at the Oberoi Trident Hotel when a man standing next to him was shot by terrorists.

He was one of an unknown number of British nationals caught up in the raids and forced to shelter from heavily-armed terrorist reportedly hunting for Westerners.

Mr Jones, in Mumbai on business, said he was with a colleague when the shooting began.

He told the BBC: ""We took the lift to the lobby and heard bangs as the door opened. A Japanese man, one of four in the lift, was shot and wounded at that precise moment.""

As the injured man slumped to the floor he obstructed the doors.

""I frantically pressed the ""close door"" button, but had to move the shot man's foot for the door to close,"" Mr Jones said.

After pulling the wounded man back into the lift they headed to their rooms, but were told by staff to head to a ""safe"" room in the hotel basement.

""There we met many residents, but nowhere near all of them,"" he told the BBC.

He was later escorted away from the hotel to an office.

Mr Jones, told CNN: ""It was absolutely terrifying.

""When the doors opened, two Japanese men riding with us got out, but immediately signalled for us to go back in the lift.

""As they got back in, a bullet hit one of the Japanese men in the back of the leg. Flesh and blood splattered everywhere.

""I looked up to see one of the gunmen was approaching. I tried to close the door, but the injured guy's leg was preventing it from closing.""

Mr Jones told the American news channel he frantically pulled the Japanese man's leg back into the lift as the gunman was bearing down on them.

""I only just kept it together enough to get the door shut,"" he added.

The 42 year old told CNN he rode to the top floor where hotel staff advised his group to seek refuge in the basement via a secure lift.

""After an hour in a ballroom, they evacuated us in groups of 10 to what they said was a safe area, although it still didn't feel very safe,"" said Mr Jones.

""We had no idea what was going on, it was crazy... chaos.""

Other western visitors and Mumbai residents told of a night of terror, ducking under tables, throwing themselves on the floor of five-star hotels as they heard the first rattle of gunfire and detonations in the lobby below.

Twelve hours after the first shots were fired in a busy Mumbai cafe, the terror attacks continued today inside two of the city's best-known hotels, where terrorists still held hostages. 

Cheryl Robinson, a British tourist trapped at Mumbai's Taj Mahal hotel, said, ""We stayed on the floor, many were lying under tables.""

Several miles away, eyewitnesses said a police van was hijacked by gunmen who opened fire on crowds that collected near two hospitals near the city police headquarters.

Ms Robinson, who was with two friends, said: ""We were at dinner when we heard shots fired. There was gunfire and explosions.

""The hotel staff told us to be quiet. The staff were stupendous. They locked the doors and warned us to sit tight.""

She said restaurants and rooms were flooded with water after a pipe burst in the chaos of the gunshots and blasts.

""We lay down in the water. We could hear the sound of people running outside. It was terrifying,"" she said.

Seven long hours later, a barefoot Ms Robinson shivered as she stood outside the burning but still majestic stone-columned hotel that belched out black smoke from shattered windows. Soldiers and firefighters helped her and several others to climb down ladders and escape the blazing edifice as the firing continued inside.

A clutch of weeping tourists from Spain, Italy and Britain, also barefoot, huddled together holding bottles of water and haversacks. They waved away journalists eager for news.

At another Mumbai landmark, the Chattrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, Nasim Inam sobbed as he spoke of seeing commuters mowed down while walking to catch the late trains home.

Four young men carrying big guns and wearing black T-shirts and blue jeans rushed in, he said. ""They just fired randomly at people and then ran away. In seconds, people fell to the ground.""

He said the attackers were 25 at the most.

""They were so young. They were young boys. I was standing behind. I was just behind. If they had turned around, it would have been me,"" he said.

Just a few miles away, eyewitnesses said gunmen hijacked a police van then opened fire on crowds that had collected near two hospitals close to the police headquarters.

""We felt the ground shake and heard the explosions,"" said Manish Tripathi, at a police cordon near one of the hospitals. ""We heard a car speed up behind us, it was a police van, but the men inside were firing at us.""

He said in seconds people around him were shot at.

""Men were screaming that they had lost their fingers. There was blood all over,"" said Mr Tripathi who escaped unhurt. ""Some were shot in the leg, some on the shoulder or hand.""

A teenager was given a life sentence today for shooting dead a young youth worker he blamed for his gold chain being taken.

Innocent dad-of-one Nathan Foster, 18, collapsed in a hail of bullets in a cold-blooded act of revenge, the Old Bailey was told.

He had been shot by 17-year-old Junior Glasgow as he sat on a low wall with friends on a hot night in August last year.

Glasgow, of Brixton, south London, was found guilty of murder last month. He was told he would have to serve a minimum of 21 years.

There were cheers and claps from the public gallery as Glasgow was sentenced by Judge Peter Rook.

He told Glasgow: ""At your young age, you have become part of the gun culture which is a blight on some of our big cities.""

Glasgow did not have the ""emotional maturity"" to deal with being robbed of his prized $800 chain and ""reacted wholly out of proportion"", said the judge.

He added: ""You carried out this terrible revenge on someone you mistakenly thought was responsible.

""You carried out a cold-blooded, premeditated execution in a public place.""

The court was told Glasgow went into the cul-de-sac where they lived in Marcus Garvey Way, Brixton, on his motor-scooter and started firing with an automatic gun.

Mr Foster, who worked with inner-city children using horses, was hit by six bullets including one through the heart.

The court was told that six hours earlier a chain was taken from Glasgow's neck by another youth.

Mr Foster's older sister Shannel told the judge: ""Nathan was killed by a coward.

""He was my best friend and my favourite brother.""

She also read an impact statement from his girlfriend Rochelle Martin, the mother of his baby son Raheem.

Julie Harrison, whose four-year-old daughter was shot dead by her estranged partner, lost her battle for life today.

Ms Harrison, who was seriously injured in the attack, died at 9.30am at St George's Hospital in Tooting, Hampshire police said.

Ex-partner Andy Copland, 56, is thought to have killed the couple's daughter Maisie with a gunshot to the head and mortally wounded Ms Harrison, 40, yesterday morning at their house in Aldershot, Hampshire.

Copland then shot himself.

Ms Harrison's ex-husband said today she was a bubbly personality with lots of friends.

Kevin Moody, 47, said he only found out about the tragedy when he got up this morning.

Print production manager Mr Moody, from Farnborough, Hants, was married to Ms Harrison from 1992 to 1996, when they split amicably.

""She was a good laugh and we had an awful lot of fun when we were together. She was a bubbly personality and had a lot of friends,"" he said.

Mr Moody said: ""We met about 18 months before we married in 1992 at a house we both rented rooms in.

""We didn't have any children and basically we split because she wanted to do the things that a single woman wanted to do and I didn't.""

Mr Moody said he kept in touch for a couple of years and that he last saw his ex-wife in 2006 at the funeral of his mother Margaret.

""I had not told her about the funeral, so it was nice of her to come. She seemed happy. She showed me loads of pictures of Maisie on her phone - she was well proud of her.

""She didn't tell me about her partner and I didn't ask. I met him once years ago but I didn't know him,"" Mr Moody explained.

Mr Moody said that his wife worked as a care assistant before they married and then she looked after mother Betty, who had multiple sclerosis and later died.

He said she had an older brother Chris who, he believed, lived in Wales and was a builder.

He said that Copland's ex-wife ran a care business but he could not remember if Ms Harrison had worked for it when they were married.

""I'm really in shock. It was all a long time ago for me now. At the end of the day she was a woman I loved,"" he added.

Earlier a neighbour told how police reacted when Copland apparently shot Maisie and Ms Harrison before turning the gun on himself.

Rachael Bryan was at home next door when a friend, Robert Wood, was prevented from parking his car by Ms Harrison's red Renault, which was parked in the road.

""She had dropped the child off and kept the engine running so Robert was kept waiting and he started tooting his horn,"" Mrs Bryan explained.

""Then a neighbour came up to him and tearfully said he (Copland) had locked his wife in the house and the police have been called.

""We went upstairs to my bedroom window and a police car with lights flashing came and a policeman knocked on the door.

""I suppose he must have seen something through the letterbox because he then started kicking in the door.

""At the next moment another police car sped in. It went right over the roundabout in front of us and he rushed in and then, looking very serious, he came out and used his radio and then the cavalry arrived with police cars and ambulances.

""Later we saw the mother coming out. She had her head strapped across the stretcher and she was put into an ambulance.""

Mrs Bryan said that she had only lived at the house for a month and had only smiled at Copland because he seemed angry. She said that Ms Harrison had left the house on November 6.

""When I moved in I was told he came home from work one day and his wife had left with their child.

""I used to see him putting the bins out but I kept my distance. He seemed angry and depressed. People said he used to be OK but his wife had left him.""

Maisie's school, St Michael's Infants in Aldershot, paid tribute to the little girl.

Head teacher Liz Mathias said: ""We were devastated to hear about the tragic incident involving Maisie.

""She was a lovely little girl and a daughter that anyone could be proud of.

""Although she had not been at our school for very long, Maisie was an involved member of the our school community and she will be sadly missed.""

Today the end-of-terrace house in Church Hill remained sealed off by police as forensic examinations continued. Three officers were standing guard.

Floral tributes continued to be placed near the house with two women laying flowers and crying before leaving.

It appears the shootings took place as Maisie was dropped off for an access visit yesterday morning.

Officers were called to the terraced property when a neighbour dialled 999 to report a row shortly after 10am and were met with a ""very traumatic"" scene.

Officers attempted to resuscitate Maisie but she was pronounced dead a short while later.

In an online tribute, family friend Sally Denny said: ""Maisie was so full of life - a happy, funny and cheeky girl who knew how to bring a smile to people's faces.

""My last memory of her was seeing her perform in the school nativity. She was dressed as a star but she will always be an angel.""

297,"Camden shooting: Teenager dies after being shot in the head

A 17-year-old boy has died after being shot in the head at the weekend in London - the 15th violent teenage death in the capital this year. 

According to local reports, Sharmaarke Hassan was shot as he sat with a group of youths on a bench overlooking the Regent's canal in Camden.  

The injured teenager, who was found shortly after 11pm on Saturday in Gilbey's Yard, was taken to hospital but died last night. 

Residents said the bench was a regular hang out for a group of youths who came in from other areas to deal drugs.

One man, who did not wish to be named, said: ""I heard a couple of bangs around half ten on Saturday night.

""I thought it was just kids with fireworks, so I didn't think anything of it, then next thing there were police everywhere.

""I've lived here since the estate was built. It used to be a nice estate but now the crime is getting much worse.""

Sharmaarke is believed to have been a member of the north-west London gang The Money Squad, one of a number of Somali gangs in the area. 

He had convictions for drugs offences, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

He was given a one-year Community Punishment Order and 40 hours of community service after being found guilty of possessing cannabis and offering to supply the drug at Thames Youth Court last month.  

Hassan was also convicted of breaching the terms of his Anti-Social Behaviour Order at the same court late last year.

The Asbo was imposed on November 2 and ordered the teenager to stay away from Buck Street in Camden - less than half a mile from where he was shot.

He broke it the following day. He appeared in court the following month for breach of the Asbo and was convicted at the same time of stealing a $2,000 Cartier watch.

His punishment for both offences was a referral order to a Youth Offending Panel.

298,"Mother caught on camera executing her son at a shooting range

This is the shocking moment a crazed mother executes her son at a shooting range, before turning the gun on herself.

Marie Moore, 44, took her 20 year-old son Mitchell to a crowded shooting range in Florida for an afternoon of target practicing together.

Little did her son know that she had planned the murder, leaving a number of suicide notes for her boyfriend.

The entire shocking story was recorded on security camera.

The mother and son were sharing a lane at the Shoot Straight shooting range in Casselberry.

As unsuspecting Mitchell concentrated on the target in front of him, his mother picked up a gun and pointed it at the back of his head, murdering him in front of onlookers.

She then placed the gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger. She died shortly afterwards in hospital.

In several notes she left behind, Moore partially explained what drove her to the horrifying murder/suicide:

""I'm so sorry. I had to send my son to heaven and myself to Hell,"" she wrote.

She also left behind rambling audio messages in which she said she planned her son's slaughter to save the world from violence.

""I have to die and go to hell so there can be a thousand years peace on earth,"" she explained in the two tapes.

""God's turned me into the Anti-Christ... I'm a good person, but the Devil and God turned me into the worst person in the world. I'm so ashamed. And I'm so afraid. And I'll pay forever and ever.""

Rock junkie Pete Doherty was finally jailed for drug offences yesterday - after repeatedly skipping rehab.

The Babyshambles star threw back his head in despair as he was sent down for 14 weeks for flouting terms of a suspended sentence.

A pal said last night: ""Pete will be devastated. He'll be sobbing his eyes out. He's absolutely terrified of prison.""

Doherty, 29, had been ordered to take regular drug tests as part of a four-month sentence, suspended for two years. It was imposed last October after he admitted possession of crack cocaine, heroin, ketamine and cannabis.

Just days later, The Sun published video grabs of him taking heroin.

He then breached his probation conditions by missing two appointments, turning up late and being rude to staff.

He was finally hauled before West London Magistrates court yesterday, where District Judge Davinder Lachhar slammed his ""unacceptable behaviour"" and ""mixed response"" to treatment.

A sick paedo has issued a compo claim for thousands of pounds because his prison cell doesn't have a toilet.

Child rapist David Williams wants $5,000, claiming his human rights were breached because he has to endure ""a substandard lifestyle"".

The 43-year-old perv was jailed in June 2007 for the rape of a young teenage boy and is now at Exeter Prison in Devon.

He was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection.

Williams, who has lived in Devon and Durham, has a series of convictions against his name dating back to the 1980s.

He was arrested for the rape shortly after serving six years for seven counts of gross misconduct against four boys aged between four and 11.

And during that sentence he refused to take part in any sex offender rehabilitation courses.

In a writ to the High Court, Williams said the lifestyle at the prison is endangering his ""physical and emotional health"".

The claims have sparked outrage from victim support groups.

Ed Usher, of Victims' Voice, said: ""The human rights of the victim are never taken into account.

""These offenders have been put behind bars because they chose to commit the crime.

""Provided they are held in decent surroundings, it's ridiculous they should make these sorts of claims for damages.""

In the claim, Williams is seeking damages under Article 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

It describes the inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of a person.

Williams claims his rights are being breached because he was ""denied"" proper sanitation facilities, washing facilities and the supply of hot water and drinking water in his cell on the prison's D-wing.

The writ claims Williams has been subjected to ""degrading and humiliating treatment"" by the prison service.

He tried to make her have sex with him, then throttled her as he forced her to engage in oral sex -- classified as rape.

Lawyers for Best -- who was 15 at the time of the attack -- argued naming him would put his life and rehabilitation at risk, as well as affect his family and ""blameless"" mother.

Kate, 32, could barely conceal her delight on her first public outing with the singer at a rock gig at Clapham, near Bedford, on Sunday.

Onlookers at the low-key Rhythm Festival were stunned when she stepped out of her chauffeur-driven Range Rover at around 7.45pm - closely followed by Pete.

""They got out of the car and held hands as they walked to the VIP area - laughing and touching each other the whole time. They were acting like a couple of honeymooners.""

Kate - who has a daughter Lila Grace, five, with magazine publisher Jefferson Hack - appeared anxious not to be pictured with Pete and they left at 9.30pm, speeding off in her car. One of Pete's friends said: ""We've heard him say he'll get clean a million times, but a lot of his attempts have been half-hearted to say the least.

""But he's shocked us all. This latest bout of treatment seems to have worked wonders.

""He's had a new implant fitted to stop opiates having an effect and he's taking pride in his appearance for the first time in months.

332,"EXCLUSIVE: New Details In Murder Of HBO Cathouse Star Brooke Phillips; Read Arrest Warrant & See Video From Scene

The man arrested in connection with the shocking murder of pregnant Cathouse prostitute turned reality TV star Brooke Phillips and several others was a champion wrestler and cage fighter, has learned.

In addition, detectives say 28-year-old David Allen Tyner -- who surrendered Tuesday to police after an eyewitness identified him at the home where the victims were burned and shot to death --  knew one of the victims and they are looking into the possibility that he was not acting alone.

Tyner was a two-time state champion wrestler and a state runner-up at Locust Grove as a high school senior in 2000; he wrestled at the University Of Tennessee Chatanooga and later joined the Marine Corps.

Tyner then became a cage fighter and completed a 6-1 record in mixed martial arts fighting bouts in Oklahoma and Kansas City in 2006 and 2007.

Jason Nicholson, a former fight promoter claimed Tyner was like a brother and planned his next fight in Kansas City next month.

""Knowing what he's charged with shocks me the most,"" Nicholson said.

Despite the horrific crime, it does not appear that Tyner had any previous police history.

Sheriff Frank Cantey said: ""We searched and cannot find where he was in trouble with the law before - I've talked to 10 people and everybody is surprised - he was a pretty good guy.""

The State Medical Examiner is having to use dental records to formally identify two of the victims - all four victims were shot (two of the women being pregnant) before someone set the house on fire.

One of the two identified victims was Brooke Philips, 22, who starred in HBO's popular Cathouse series.

She was a licensed prostitute at the Nevada brothel and was taking time off from the Moonlite Bunny Ranch because she was pregnant.

Services have been arranged for the other known victim Milagros Barrera for 11am Friday at Chisholm Heights Baptist Church in Mustang.

Barrera - who was also pregnant - was a cell phone saleswoman.

The mother of Jasmine Fiore's ex-husband told RadarOnline.com that her son Michael Cardosi held out hopes of rekindling a romance with the stunning model before she was brutally murdered by another ex, Ryan Jenkins. The pair even saw one another days before she died.

Michael Cardosi - who was married to Fiore for three years - reunited with her on a Southern California beach while he was out on parole for a drugs-related crime. They were spotted being affectionate with one another but three days later she was dead.

""When Michael told me that Jasmine had died we just collapsed and fell into one another's arms sobbing,"" Winnie Humphreys told Radar Online.com. ""He told me ""Mom she was the love of my life - we were soul mates"". He was absolutely devastated.""

A former construction worker and bartender, Cardosi was recently put back in jail for violating his parole conditions and Humphreys was fearful for his health after Fiore's passing. He was released from Riverside County Jail on Friday.

""Michael was terribly depressed when he went back into prison and I was really worried for him because he truly loved Jasmine,"" she said. ""They had known each other for eight years and had been through some good and bad times together but always stayed in touch even when Michael was sent to jail.""

Murdered pervert Andrew Cunningham was targeted by hate mobs who yelled ""Die, paedo, die"" at him.

And a police source said: ""He was loathed by a large number of people so we have a lot of potential suspects.""

Cunningham, 52, died from multiple stab wounds to the head, neck and chest. And the source revealed: ""Damage was caused to his genitals.""

The dead man worked as a trucker for the Riverside Haulage company in Wandsworth, South West London -- and lived in a tatty caravan at the firm's depot.

But his warped lust for children had made him enemies for years.

He spent four months behind bars in 2001 for raping a schoolgirl under 13.

He was arrested again in 2003 but no charges were pressed.

Soon afterwards vigilantes set fire to his former home in a Wandsworth street after discovering he was brazenly grooming kids.

He fled and set up in the caravan. But drinkers at a pub recently accused him of fondling a barmaid's two-year-old daughter.

And mobs drove past the depot shouting he was scum and a ""nonce"" who should die.

The police source said his murder was ""almost certainly connected to new offences rather than those that took place in 2001"".

Cunningham was a father of five estranged from a former partner.

Police, who believe more than one person was involved in the killing, had to identify him using fingerprints because none of his relatives would go to the morgue.

The pervert's body was found by his boss after he failed to start work on Wednesday morning.

The employer, who would not give his name, said there was no sign of forced entry at the caravan.

He added: ""He had a stab wound in his neck and there was blood everywhere. The bed was soaked with it and his head was lying in it.""

A former neighbour from the Wandsworth street told how Cunningham regularly got a ""hiding"" from people who knew about his vile behaviour.

Joe Hart, 46, said: ""He used to befriend young lads and invite them round, letting them do what they wanted in his home. He'd ask the boys to bring over young girls, then make passes at them.""

The mum of a 15-year-old schoolgirl who died in India has spoken of her belief that her daughter was raped and murdered.

Indian police have initially said that Scarlett Keeling, from Devon, accidentally drowned.

But the girl's mother, Fiona MacKeown says that evidence from a post-mortem examination shows that she was killed at the popular resort of Anjuna, Goa.

The post-mortem examination showed that Scarlett suffered at least five after death abrasions on her face, back and shins and she had sand in her mouth and trachea.

It also found that she had hardly enough water in her body to have drowned.

The pathologist also confirmed that Scarlett had recently had sexual intercourse although it was not clear whether it was by force.

Several days after Scarlett's death on February 18, Ms MacKeown found her daughter's underwear, shorts and sandals, one of which had a broken strap.

Ms MacKeown said that she had hired an Indian lawyer to seek ""justice"" for her daughter.

She told a national newspaper: ""Scarlett's death was no accident.

""She was a very good swimmer - she grew up body-boarding near where we live.

""Some people believe Scarlett was drunk on her last night, but I know my daughter, she wasn't a drinker. She just didn't like drinking.""

Ms MacKeown took Scarlett, her partner and six other children, from her home in Bideford, Devon, in November for a dream trip to India.

But after an argument with her daughter, she left her in the charge of a local tour guide while the rest of the family visited other areas.

Friendless misfit, 18, beat little Lauren with bat ""for no reason""

A youth of 18 who battered 10-year-old Lauren Pilkington-Smith to death was a misfit loner who had no friends of his own age.

Kieron Smith, who was yesterday convicted of Lauren's murder, left school at 13 and spent his days with his dog and cage birds, watching television and playing computer games.

After younger children returned from school, he would play cricket and football with them.

Lauren was beaten with a bat by her 6ft 1in neighbour after they had played cricket on July 7.

Det Chief Insp Shaun Donnellan said yesterday: ""The truth is that there is no background to this case because there was no reason for what he did. Little Lauren is from a loving, warm, nurturing family and she made the mistake of extending her friendship to Kieron Smith, who manipulated that friendship and battered her to death. Quite why, we may never know.""

Smith, of Leigh, Greater Manchester, suffered from Asperger syndrome, an autism-like disorder which can lead to eccentric behaviour, relationship difficulties, and communication problems.

But his legal team didn't put his illness forward in their defence case.

He left school early because he ""didn't like the crowds, they made me feel anxious"".

Education services tried to find a solution but gave up when he turned 16.

Ken Pilkington, Lauren's grandad, said after the verdict at Liverpool crown court: ""At least the jury has had the common sense to put this fellow away for good.

""Hearing what happened in court has been terrible. We didn't know the full extent of the injuries. We are devastated.""

Ken found her partly stripped body under leaves in woods later that night with a sock forced into her mouth and two twigs shoved up each nostril.

Smith denied killing her but DNA tests showed her blood on his trainers.

Lauren's gran Pat Smith read out a family statement yesterday.

It said: ""Lauren had a wonderful sense of humour, she always had a smile on her face.

""She was very keen on all sports and we used to go as a family to watch her on school sports day.

""The only outing we have now is to the cemetery. We will never know what the future would have held for Lauren. But at least she would have had a future.""

She added: ""We have been deprived of seeing Lauren grow up into a sensitive, caring adult, which she was as a child. Lauren's death has destroyed us. We get up thinking about Lauren and we go to bed at night thinking about Lauren.""

341,"My brutal boyfriend murdered my baby..but my silence killed her too

As Tina Hunt poignantly places flowers on her baby's grave, the pain and heartache are unbearable.

For not only has she lost her beloved 16-month-old daughter Amy - she knows her own silence killed the tot.

If Tina had shopped her vicious boyfriend James Howson, precious Amy could still be alive today.

But the 26-year-old mum is now racked with guilt because she never found the courage to tell cops of the beatings he dished out.

And her silence allowed him to kill Amy by snapping her spine in two.

Evil Howson was caged for life for murdering the tot after brutally abusing her for months.

Tina herself got a suspended jail sentence for failing to act.

But today she opens her heart about the tragedy to give hope to other victims of domestic violence.

And her revealing interview comes as Britain reels over the horrific death of 17-month-old Baby P in Haringey, north London, following months of unimaginable torture at home.

Tina told The People: ""I lived in fear of the constant beatings from James.

""He threatened to kill my family if I ever told on him.

""I wish with allmy heart I had done something before it was too late.

""But I never, ever imagined he would attack an innocent, helpless child - his own daughter.

""He seemed to be a doting dad who insisted on changing her, bathing her, feeding her and putting her to bed.

""But now I realise it was only to hide the horrible cruelty he was also subjecting her to.""

Tina added: ""Every day I miss her smiling face, hearing her call me Mummy and watching her play. I wish I was dead - not her.""

Tina already had a five-year-old son Ryan when she fell for Howson in 2004.

She said: ""He made me laugh and feel secure. I thought he was wonderful and we moved in together.""

She had no idea he had a history of beating girlfriends - and was excluded from school at 14 for violence.

One of his teachers even predicted Howson would one day kill someone.

Tina first sawhis cruelty when she found out she was pregnant with Amy.

She recalled: ""He went mad and told me to have an abortion.

""When I said I wanted to keep the baby he dragged me upstairs by the hair and locked me in our bedroom. I was terrified.

""After an hour he let me out and apologised, saying how much he loved me.

""He was so remorseful I didn't think he'd do it again.

""But now I realise I should have left him that very day.""

Amy was born at Tina's local hospital in Doncaster, South Yorks, in August 2006.

Tina was overwhelmed by love for the tot - but Howson started bingeing on drugs. She said: ""He became more and more violent to me.

He was addicted to cannabis and when he ran out he turned on me.

""One time he threw sharp kitchen knives at me, another time he smashed my head against a door. He would also slap me and punch me on a daily basis.

""He said he'd burn down my parents' home with them inside if I told on him.

""I'd regularly be covered in bruises and have black eyes - but if anybody asked why, I would always lie.""

The violence was always followed by apologies and promises of love.

Tina said: ""I still loved him. I hoped the violence would stop and he'd return to being the man I'd first met.""

Tina found out she was pregnant again last year - and Howson reacted by becoming a brutal control freak.

He banned her wearing skirts, battered her if she spoke, ordered her not to see her parents Carol, 48, and Colin - who were looking after Ryan - and completely took over Amy's welfare.

Tina said: ""He barely let me near her.

I didn't intervene because I was so pleased he was being a good dad.

""I was also so ill with pregnancy sickness - and terrified of him.""

Her fear deepened when Howson tried to strangle her after he ran out of drugs.

She said: ""I was blue in the face and could barely breathe.""

Howson panicked and rang Colin, 48, telling him Tina felt dizzy. Warehouse worker Colin rushed to the house - and Tina collapsed.

He said: ""I rang 999 and she went to the hospital. I askedwhat happened and she just said she had gone light-headed."" Amy spent the night with her grandparents - and gave them a first clue something was terribly wrong.

Colin said: ""As I tried to take her arms out of her coat she screamed.

""It was a horrible hysterical scream - not normal crying.""

Colin told his daughter to take Amy to a GP.

But Tina said: ""Jameswouldn't let me. He said she was fine and just got her arm stuck in her cot.

""Then I noticed her foot was swollen too. He said it happened at the same time - and I believed him.

""He said doctors would presume Amy was being abused and get social services involved. I was so scaredof himI didn't dare defy him.""

Two days before Christmas last year Howson woke Tina to tell her Amy was struggling to breathe - and pregnant Tina ran down the street in her pyjamas to get her dad. Colin said: ""Amy had a huge bruise on her forehead.

""I asked James what it was and he said she'd fallen out of bed.""

Amy was rushed to hospital - where she died.

Tina said: ""I was in shock. The day before I had watched as she gazed at the Christmas tree baubles but now she was gone.""

Howson and Tina were both arrested soon afterwards.

Tina recalled: ""The police said they thought James had murdered her but I didn't want to believe it.

I was accused of allowing my daughter to be attacked. I hadn't. But I hadn't stood up to him and taken her to a safe house.""

Howson was jailed for a minimum 22 years by Leeds Crown Court.

Tina admitted cruelty and allowing the death of a child and was given 12 months suspended.

She said: ""I admitted cruelty because I knew James was violent and I hadn't taken Amy to the doctors with her arm and foot.""

She added: ""James robbed my daughter of her life and destroyed mine and I can never forgive him.

""He should NEVER be released from prison - he is pure evil.""

Colin said: ""Nobody can imagine what her life was like with him. She was absolutely terrified of what might happen if she went for help.

I only wish she'd told me. If I'd had any inkling at all then I'd have gone to the house and Amy would still be alive today.""

Tina gave birth to new daughter Christina in July and the baby was immediately taken into care. Colin now plans to go to court in a bid to get custody of her.

He said: ""Tina is working hard at sorting out her life but it's going to be a long and difficult process. She's never going to get over losing Amy but we have to do our best for Christina - that is our No1 priority.""",uncertain,training
342,"Murdered Over Who Got Up To Feed The Baby

Killer dad Christopher Adams confessed to police: ""I don't know what happened mate. I just lost it.""

Adams, 26, battered girlfriend 19-year-old Claire Ford 10 times with a cricket bat.

He then hit 18-month-old baby Charlotte - known affectionately as Charlie by her family - across her head leaving her badly wounded but still alive.

The evil dad then taped a plastic bag over the little girl's head and smothered her.

In a terrible twist of fate Claire's own dad, ambulance driver Mike Ford, 45, was one of the first paramedics to arrive at the house.

He had no idea when called out to the double murder that the victims were his own daughter and granddaughter. On the way to the house he had been reassuring rookie paramedic Claire Beattie not to worry.

It was only as he entered the drive that he realised the terrible tragedy had happened at the home of his daughter's in-laws.

Police had to stop him from rushing in to the house in Rumford, Cornwall.

A colleague identified the baby from a photograph which the proud grandad had shown her. Adams later rang police to report the killings but then went on the run for eight days before he was arrested in Hampshire.

The trainee pub manager was jailed for life yesterday at Truro crown court. He pleaded guilty to both murders. Jailing him for a minimum of 20 years Judge Graham Cottle told him: ""You murdered your partner in an outburst of violent rage with repeated blows with a cricket bat. It was a frenzied attack during which you struck her repeatedly.

""You then struck your defenceless and helpless child and then knotted and taped a bag around her head. You then made a 999 call in which you pretended to have discovered the bodies, an attempt to leave a false trail.""

Adams and Claire were on holiday at Adams' parent's farmhouse in April. The killings happened in the bedroom at 7am.

The court was told the couple were having problems because Adams felt he was doing more than his fair share of child care.

The attack happened after he had been up in the early hours looking after Charlotte.

Geoffrey Mercer, defending, said: ""This was the most terrible and unforeseen event.

""They rarely argued, but there were two sources of tension. The first being the long hours which he worked - and the second, him feeling overwhelmed with the chores and caring for Charlotte. For this tragedy to have happened there must have been a substantial build up of tension over a very long time. He clearly lost control.""

Martin Meeke, QC, prosecuting, said Adams lost his temper after getting into a row with Claire and began swinging the cricket bat.

He told the court that when arrested, Adams said: ""I don't know what happened - I just lost it."" He said he had been up feeding the baby and when he returned to the bedroom Claire had pushed him away and he attacked her.

He hit her with the cricket bat which he kept in the bedroom but told police he had hit baby daughter by accident as he swung the bat. He could not remember suffocating little Charlotte.

Mr Meeke said: ""Adams was said to be over the moon when his daughter was born.

""He was a devoted partner and father and nothing has been uncovered by the police begins to explain his killing of them.

""At 11.25 am on the morning of the killing Adams phoned 999 from a National Trust property in Cornwall and reported there had been a murder. ""He told the operator ""She has been beaten around the head and the baby has had a plastic bag over her head"".""

""I do not know what has happened. I haven't got a clue. I just found her in a back bedroom. There was blood everywhere.""

Det Insp Karl Fellowes said ""We still do not fully understand why Adams committed this horrific crime. He and Claire and Charlie were together in the days before the murder and there was no sign they were anything other than happy together.""

He added "" It is impossible to comprehend how Mike felt as he arrived at the scene.

""He had not recognised the house from the call-out. It was only as he got there that he realised where he was.""

Mobile phone pictures of the brutal attack were taken by a crowd of up to 40 people hanging around in the subway.

Kashif, 16, had only moved to Ilford, Essex, from Stepney, East London, six months ago because his parents thought it was a better place for him, sister Zainab, eight, and brother Tasif, 14, to grow up.

""I gave him some money to buy a pair of boots and a boiler suit for his college motor mechanics course. He had just started this week and loved it.

""Then my nephew called to say he had been stabbed. He was a good boy and was not in any gangs. He didn't have any problems with anybody. This must have been something very minor which got blown up out of proportion. Ilford is a dangerous place. There are lots of gangs here and the police turn a blind eye.""

Some of the teenagers who saw the stabbing tried to give Kashif first aid after he collapsed.

Yesterday Kashif's killer was still at large. But police have CCTV film from the subway showing the attack. Det Chief Insp Keith Garnish said the boy's death was a ""tragic waste of life"".

He added: ""The gang of Asians were wearing sportswear and some had baseball caps and hooded tops. After the incident there were around 40 people milling around.

344,"Murdered...For Falling Out Of Love

It is a picture full of promise. And one that breaks Patricia Walsh's heart every time she sees it. Looking at a photo of her murdered daughter, Samantha, is almost too much for Patricia to take.

Fighting back tears, Patricia, 47, says: ""Samantha was so beautiful - everyone loved her and she had everything to live for. We'll never get over having her taken away from us.""

Just weeks after this picture was taken, 17-year-old Samantha was attacked with a hammer by her ex-boyfriend, Patrick O'Connor, as she walked to college, leaving her with fatal head injuries.

O'Connor, 20, denied murder but was convicted unanimously by a jury in March 2002. But because of a change in the law, Sammy's family suffered an agonising four-year wait before finding out how long he would spend behind bars.

Even now, they struggle to cope with their loss. As Patricia, from Fleetwood, Lancs, says: ""To think we welcomed him into our house.

""He ate at our table and we did everything we could to make him a part of the family. Then he ripped our family apart. When he couldn't have Sammy, he did something so awful it's still hard for us to understand.""

When they first met, no one could have imagined the romance would end in savagery.

Working alongside each other in a local shop - Sammy as a Saturday girl and O'Connor on the drinks counter - they seemed typical teenage sweethearts.

Initially Patricia was pleased her daughter had met someone special. But when Patricia and Sammy's stepfather, Steve Bond, 55, met O'Connor they had doubts about him.

As she says: ""He used to brood and seemed to go into black moods whenever we saw him.

""If you ever had an argument, he'd obsess about what had been said for days on end.

""To this day, it baffles me what Sammy saw in him. I knew he wasn't ideal for my lovely daughter.

""She couldn't have been more different - she was so bright, outgoing, with a wide circle of friends, but socialising wasn't his scene. They only ever went round to each other's houses or to the cinema.

""It seemed Patrick didn't like Sammy having any outside friends. Looking back, he was trying to control her.""

But Patricia didn't interfere, hoping the relationship would just fizzle out.

When Sammy passed her GCSEs and started A levels at sixth-form college, she seemed to drift away from O' Connor. She told her family she hoped to go on to university to train as a child psychologist.

""My little girl was finding her independence,"" Patricia says. ""But Patrick was a dark, brooding force in the background. He was possessive and jealous as they grew apart.""

It was then the family started to notice bruises on Sam's arms and neck. She brushed their concerns aside, saying they were accidental. Fighting back tears, Patricia says: ""I had no idea what was happening and if I thought he'd laid a finger on her I'd have gone straight to the police.""

Patricia was glad when Samantha ended the relationship after a series of rows. But O'Connor wouldn't accept it was over and started stalking his ex.

""Patrick kept ringing,"" says Patricia. ""We'd hear Sammy screaming down the phone at him to leave her alone. I asked whether me and Steve should have a word with him but she said she could cope.""

Then, to everyone's relief, O'Connor told Sammy he was leaving town. ""He even went to my mum and dad's house to say goodbye,"" says Patricia.

""He came to our house but I told him to go away. We thought that would be the end of it."" But it wasn't, as Patricia found out when a friend of Sammy's saw O'Connor in town. He'd had lied about leaving. And in the next six weeks he began following Sammy wherever she went.

After spying on her as she enjoyed a night out with friends, he even sent her a chilling text message warning: ""If I can't have you, no one can.""

Patricia spotted him lingering near the bus stop where Sammy was later attacked - carrying a plastic bag Patricia thinks may have held the murder weapon.

She says: ""Just two days before it happened I saw him - with the carrier bag.

""My heart sank. I thought to myself ""oh God, he's still here."" When Sam got home I told her. She just said ""I'm scared now."""" One month after her 17th birthday, Sammy was on her way to college when O'Connor pounced as she got off the bus.

Watched by four terrified children, he battered her with a builder's hammer, leaving her with appalling head injuries.

When Patricia heard an ambulance rush past, she thought nothing of it - until the police arrived.

Voice shaking with emotion, she says: ""An officer walked up my driveway and knocked on my door.

""He just said, ""Your daughter's been attacked. It's very serious."" I knew straight away who had done it.""

When Patricia, Steve and Sammy's real dad, Paddy, arrived at her bedside, their daughter was still alive.

Her skull had been fractured and one of her fingers almost severed in the attack. Surgeons at Preston Royal Hospital spent four hours battling to save her but without success.

""It was too late,"" says Patricia tearfully. ""There was just no hope. I had to make the decision to switch off her life support machine.

""That was it. That was the end of my Sam because of some petty creature's jealousy. She was only five foot, she didn't stand a chance.""

Police arrested O'Connor, who had slashed his wrists, after breaking down the door of his home in Fleetwood. At his trial, at Preston Crown Court, he denied murder, saying he couldn't remember the attack.

But the jury heard excerpts from his diary detailing his frustrations, as well as threats to kill Sammy's step-father and a man he suspected of being her new boyfriend.

Described by the judge as ""a great danger to the public"", he was found guilty and given life. But it was only recently that he and the Walsh family were told exactly how long he would spend behind bars.

As Patricia says: ""The law has changed since Sammy's murder and it's now the responsibility of the judge rather than the Home Secretary to set the sentence. That's why it's only just been reviewed and we've found out O'Connor will have to serve a minimum of 15 years.""

She doesn't believe it is anywhere near long enough.

""Our family is serving a life sentence and yet he'll be out by the time he's 35. I dread the day he is released on parole.""

Patricia adds: ""I just hope Sam's death can act as a warning to others. If anybody out there has split with their boyfriend and he won't leave her alone, then go to the police. I wouldn't want any family to go through what we've been through.""

Now Patricia tries to focus on Sammy's younger sister, Kelly.

""Seeing her do well at college keeps me going,"" smiles Patricia. ""Like her sister, she is a good student. She wants to be a forensic scientist and although she's been through so much pain, she's such a star.

""I just wish Sammy could be here to see it.""",uncertain,training
345,"Murdered policewoman Nisha Patel-Nasri: Husband Fadi Nasri faces life in jail for her killing

A cheating husband who ordered the knife killing of his police wife faced life jail last night for his ""final betrayal"".

Debt-ridden Fadi Nasri had special constable Nisha Patel, 29, murdered so he could collect s367,000 life insurance and live in luxury with his hooker mistress Laura Mockiene.

Nisha's brother yesterday revealed he knew something wasn't quite right and could not bring himself to hug Nasri at Nisha's funeral.

Katen Patel had no idea callous husband Fadi Nasri, 34, had ordered two henchmen to arrange Nisha's stabbing - but he sensed deep down something was wrong.

After Nasri was convicted of murder yesterday Katen, 35, said: ""Although I didn't think he could be involved in any way I couldn't put my arms around him.

""It wasn't because I didn't want to, but because something wasn't right.

""Now I know. The attack on Nisha was barbaric. Her killers showed no mercy and have shown none since.

""It's not a man but a coward who attacks a woman with a knife. Nisha was alone and defenceless. That the man she loved was responsible makes it all the more wicked.""

Cheating Nasri, son of a suspected double killer, reckoned Nisha, 29, was worth more dead than alive.

Alive, his hard-working wife got in the way of his passionate affair with Lithuanian hooker Laura Mockiene, 25, on who he blew s15,000.

With her dead, the limo firm boss could collect s367,000 in two life policies, clear s225,000 debts, get a half share in a house Nisha's parents left her and carry on living the high life with his secret lover.

Det Chief Insp Nick Scola said: ""Nisha was a loving wife murdered so her selfish husband could lead a luxury lifestyle with his younger mistress. That Nasri instigated the murder plan is the final betrayal.""

A police source added: ""Nisha was working like a dog, running her own hairdressing business and helping out with his car business.

""Meanwhile, all the time Nasri was spending money on Laura without blinking. With his debts growing, Nasri didn't think about stopping his affair. His solution was to get rid of his wife. Nisha was more valuable to him dead. It was as simple as that.""

Yesterday at the Old Bailey Nasri was convicted of murder after a three-month trial.

Drug dealer Rodger Leslie, 38, who arranged the killing and 6ft 4in bouncer Jason Jones, 36, who stabbed Nisha with her own 13in kitchen knife, were also convicted of murder. All three men face life jail when they are sentenced on June 20.

Lebanese-born Nasri had violence flowing in his blood. In 1999 his violent father Farouk, 54, was charged with murdering girlfriend Jennifer Elverson, 37, and her son Ben, seven, by setting fire to them at their home in Derby. He hanged himself in Leicester jail before trial.

Nasri went on to marry Middlesex catering manager Simona Marin, 18. The unhappy relationship lasted only three years.

Simona said: ""He wasn't good to me. I'm scared of saying more because the people he associates with aren't nice.""

In marrying Nisha, Nasri had a devoted partner who worked hard for his success.

But although the couple were openly affectionate the marriage came under strain and Nisha even considered divorce.

Nasri had other plans. On May 11, 2006, he ensured Nisha was alone at home in Wembley, North London, while he played snooker with a pal to give himself an alibi.

He gave Leslie a set of keys to allow Jones to let himself into the house.

After stabbing Nisha, Jones fled to a car driven by career crook Tony Emmanuel, 42, and shortly afterwards dumped the knife in a drain.

Emmanuel was cleared of murder after claiming he believed he was driving Jones to a drug deal. Pumping blood, Nisha staggered from her porch into the road screaming ""He's following me!""

As police hunted a suspected burglar, Nasri appealed for witnesses. With chilling irony, he said: ""Obviously, someone has got a guilty conscience.""",uncertain,training
346,"Paris Jackson's tribute necklace

Singer's daughter remembers her father with a piece of jewellery

Paris Jackson, 11, gave the piece of jewellery to her late father when she visited his body at LA Forest Lawn Cemetery last Monday to make sure he always had something to remind him of her. Michael's elder sister La Toya, who witnessed the heartbreaking act during the family's private viewing, said: ""Paris told me, ""The heart is in two pieces. I want one half to go to daddy and I will wear the other half forever."" ""She carefully wrapped it around his wrist and said, ""Daddy this is for you. On daddy, it will be blue because he is cold. On me, it's purple. He's so cold, he is so cold.""""

Paris bought the necklace - which changes colour according to temperature - after Michael died of a suspected cardiac arrest last month and she wore it when she made her emotional tribute to him at his memorial service last Tuesday. As well as the jewellery, Paris also got some coloured stones to decorate her dad's body with. La Toya - who has claimed Michael was murdered by the ""shadowy entourage"" he surrounded himself - also recalled the moment she first saw Paris and her brothers, Prince Michael I and Prince Michael II after the singer's death.

She said: ""When I got to the hospital my mother was crying and the kids were crying. I screamed, ""Is it true?"" and my mother said, ""Yes, he's gone."" ""I couldn't stop crying. I'm screaming and the kids are screaming. My mother was sitting there with all three of them on her lap, just crying."" La Toya also revealed Michael was not the biological father of Prince Michael II, also known as ""Blanket"", revealing the youngster was conceived via artificial insemination.

She said: ""Michael didn't want to know who the biological parents were. They took eggs from a donor and I believe the sperm came from one of five donors picked from a book. ""I don't know who carried the child or if the surrogate knew whose child she was carrying. ""Those children were his greatest joy.

He can be seen reading the names and ages of some of the women he claims to have had unprotected sex with in the video clips on website YouTube.

The videos - one of which has been viewed 195,000 times - also feature a web address to a ""gangsta"" portal filled with pornography and where Trashman has a profile.

A chart-topping pop star in Germany's most successful girl band is facing ten years in jail over claims she infected a lover with HIV.

Sexy singer Nadja Benaissa is accused of having unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she had the virus.

Benaissa, 26, and her girl band No Angels -- the country's answer to Girls Aloud -- shot to nationwide fame after winning a TV reality show.

But despite her celebrity status judges in Berlin sensationally ruled Germany's biggest media outlet Axel Springer Verlag could not cover the trial.

The singer's legal team argued coverage would breach her privacy and are now considering a request to widen the ban to all German media.

The ban currently covers the country's biggest selling quality daily newspaper Bild and a host of other in-house publications.

Judges have been accused of interfering in the public's right to know.

Bild editor Kai Diekmann said: ""Posters of her are hanging in thousands of teenagers' bedrooms. She is a role model and there is no doubt about the right of the public for information.

""This decision is an assault on press freedom.""

Media pundits have been bemused by the ban. The singer was only fully identified after leading state prosecutor Albrecht Schreiber confirmed her arrest.

Meanwhile, it emerged today that mum-of-one Benaissa was once addicted to crack as a 14-year-old.

Benaissa became a celebrity overnight when she and four other girls beat more than 4,500 rivals to win the first series of TV talent show Popstars in 2000.

No Angels has sold more than five million records and has had seven number one singles and albums in Germany.

Margaret Marshall was speaking after an inquest into the death of her 30-year-old son Stephen which concluded he contracted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) through eating contaminated beef.

Mrs Marshall, from Richmond, North Yorkshire, said the father of one had probably become infected 10 years before, when he used to eat burgers regularly.

She said: ""I think it was from when he was about 18 or 19, when he was travelling about a lot. He used to live on burgers.""

She added: ""It's a devastating illness, I would not wish it on anybody""

Mr Marshall was diagnosed with vCJD last December. He died in March.

Teesside coroner Michael Sheffield recorded a misadventure verdict in Middlesbrough yesterday.

He said he was satisfied Mr Marshall, who left a two-year-old daughter, died through his ""unknowing"" consumption of infected beef.

Doctors believe exposure to mad cow disease (BSE) could be widespread in the UK despite there being only 160 vCJD cases so far identified.

Earlier this year, British scientists said the number of people infected could be far higher than originally thought because of a longer incubation period.

They believe the time between infection with BSE and developing vCJD could be more than 50 years.

According to figures from the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh, 2,079 suspected cases of all types of CJD have been referred to them since 1990.

Of those, 111 people have definitely died from vCJD, with a further 45 probable deaths from vCJD.

They had tests for HIV - the virus that causes AIDS - after the girl told them she had found out she was infected. She has no idea whether she contracted the disease before or after she slept with them all.

The stars, who play for three different clubs, cannot be named for legal reasons.

361,"Did I Inject My Son With HIV?

Linda Wooliscroft watched her haemophiliac son die at 25 from HIV - and she fears she injected it into him. She is not alone in her pain. Almost 2,000 patients died after they were supplied with contaminated blood by the NHS. As a public inquiry opens, Linda 59, from Wolverhampton, tells her story...

""Michael grimaced as I pushed a needle into a vein in his arm, then smiled when I took it out again."" ""Thanks, Mum,"" he said. ""You're much better at doing this than I am.""

Michael suffered from the blood disorder haemophilia. Every time he had a little knock I had to give him an injection. He could do it himself but if I was around, he always preferred me to do it for him.

He was almost two when we found out what was wrong with him. I'd noticed that something wasn't right when he started taking his first steps. He was constantly falling over and would sometimes be covered in bruises.

I kept taking him to the GP but was told it was nothing to worry about. Eventually he was referred to Birmingham Children's Hospital. Tests showed he had haemophilia.

It meant his blood lacked the ability to clot so even a little bump would cause internal bleeding, leaving Michael in agony.

I was horrified when they told me it was life-threatening. ""He might make it to 21 if he's lucky,"" one of the doctors told me.

I was a single mum and barely over 21 myself. How would I cope with this?

Further tests showed that I was a haemophilia carrier and had unknowingly passed it on to Michael. The disorder predominantly affects boys but is passed on by females. As I've got three sisters, I hadn't realised it was in the family.

Michael's diagnosis changed my life overnight. As soon as he had a fall or banged himself, I had to rush him to hospital so he could be injected with the clotting factor his blood needed.

I was on tenterhooks hoping that he wouldn't hurt himself. But the more I read up on the condition, the more I realised that Michael could live beyond 21.

As long as I took care of him, I knew that Michael could live a long and healthy life.

And as he got older, life got easier. Michael stopped falling over as much so we needed to make less trips to the hospital - and I met my husband Paul, who's now 53.

We got chatting when he started to deliver bread to the primary school where I worked as a cook. Paul and Michael got on like a house on fire and we soon became a family.

I told Paul early on that I didn't want any more children. I couldn't risk having another child with haemophilia. Luckily he understood and we got married when Michael was eight.

Around the same time, I began injecting Michael at home. It meant that I didn't have to rush Michael to hospital every time he had a fall or a knock.

Despite his condition, he lived a normal life. He had lots of friends and loved football, playing and watching. As he got older, the hospital taught him to inject himself but if I was in he'd always ask me to do it for him.

When Michael was 17, we were called in to see one of the doctors at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Paul drove us but waited in the car. I presumed because he was now an adult the meeting would be about transferring him a different hospital. I couldn't have been more wrong.

""Do you realise that Michael is HIV positive?"" the doctor said.

""What?"" I spluttered, looking at my son as he stared straight ahead. I went into shock.

My mind flew back to a couple of years earlier. There had been things in the news about the NHS using infected blood.

Some patients had contracted HIV and hepatitis C as a result, but I'd been given no reason to believe Michael was at risk.

As the doctor told me otherwise, I started to shake. I instantly thought: I have injected my son with infected blood. I felt dreadful and Michael was silent, uncomprehending. None of us spoke in the car on the way home. ""Please don't tell anyone about this,"" Michael begged me when we got inside. He didn't want his friends or his nan to know what was wrong with him.

Even though it wasn't his fault, he was embarrassed about having a virus with such a stigma attached to it.

Michael had fought against haemophilia all his life, now he'd have to fight against HIV too.

It was like a big black cloud hanging over us. ""If only we'd known what we were doing,"" he said to me once. I was probably the one who'd injected him with the virus but deep down I knew it wasn't my fault.

Michael was determined not to let HIV ruin his life though. ""I don't know how much time I've got left,"" he told me. ""So I'm going to make the most of it.""

He got some compensation because of his diagnosis so Michael shelved his plans to get a full-time job and decided to go travelling instead. Over the next few years he went to Australia twice and visited Tenerife and the Caribbean.

But HIV was never far from his thoughts.

He was in his early 20s when he started seeing his first serious girlfriend. Before they got intimate he had to tell her about the virus. ""We both had a cry when I told her,"" he said to me afterwards.

It broke my heart to see him starting out his adult life with this hanging over him, but Michael's girlfriend stood by him and they stayed together for several years.

Michael's health was always up and down though. The virus broke down his immune system and he took up to 13 pills a day to fight it.

When he was 24 he got an infection in his blood and his head swelled to twice its normal size.

""I'm going to die,"" he kept telling me at the hospital.

""No you're not. We're going to fight this,"" I insisted. And while he did get over that, we both knew he couldn't fight forever. A year later he began complaining of earache. Then he started being sick all the time and he decided it was time to tell his friends that he was HIV positive.

They were so shocked. Michael had spent the past seven years pretending to them that everything in his life was great.

But now his strength was fading and he developed meningitis. We took him into hospital and I slept in a little bed beside his.

Despite his obvious weakness, I was determined that he would be out for his 26th birthday. I even asked my sister Pat to make him a birthday cake.

But Michael couldn't fight any more. He fell into a coma and I realised he was nearing the end.

I was holding his hand when he took his last breath. It was May 26, 1995 - only a week before his 26th birthday.

Michael's death tore my world apart. It seemed so unfair that my handsome, loving son was gone and through no fault of his own. The crematorium was packed for his funeral, but I didn't need anyone to tell me what I had lost.

There had been odd times when Michael got angry about what had happened, but mostly he just wanted to get on with his life. It must have taken such courage and I'm so proud of him.

I'm certainly not alone in what I've been through. Thousands were infected with HIV or hepatitis C through contaminated blood and blood products.

Michael should never have been exposed to it in the first place and I am still angry that my son was taken from me in what should have been the prime of his life.

It's now 12 years since Michael passed on but not a day goes by when I don't think about him.

An independent public inquiry is currently looking at why and how this ever happened. But you can't change the past - I just hope it will stop anything like this ever happening again.",uncertain,test
362,"I hadn't had sex for over 14 years how could I be HIV positive?

Mandy Webb, 42, was horrified when she was diagnosed HIV positive, especially as she hadn't had sex for over a decade. Now, with the 21st World Aids Day on Monday, she wants everyone to learn from her story.

With her shock of pink hair, Mandy Webb is no shrinking violet - and that's the point.

After being diagnosed with HIV six years ago, the mum-of-one is determined to stand out and highlight that anyone can fall victim to the disease.

She says: ""I'm living proof that HIV doesn't just affect gay men and drug users - a one-night stand can have lasting consequences.""

Mandy first noticed something was wrong back in 1990, when her son, Ben, was two. She says: ""I kept getting bruises but I put it down to having an active two-year-old. I frequently knocked myself carrying Ben, the shopping and pushchair up and down stairs.""

She went to her GP for blood tests and the results showed Mandy's platelets (which help the blood to clot) were dangerously low, meaning she risked bleeding to death. 

They couldn't find a cause for the problem but she was put on steroids to help her blood clot. However the drugs made her weight balloon.

In 1991, doctors offered Mandy another option - to have her spleen removed and be given injections of factor Vlll (a blood protein) to help her blood to clot.

Mandy went ahead but after surgery she kept getting chest infections. And, over the years, her health deteriorated.

Suffering from diarrhoea, Mandy's weight plummeted to under eight stone and her periods stopped. She developed painful mouth ulcers and night sweats.

Getting Ben to school and combining her college course in art and design with her part-time catering job exhausted her.

Her GP diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome and prescribed anti-depressants for stress... which Mandy didn't take.

""I tried to make the best of things,"" she explains, ""but it got worse and worse. I know it's tiring bringing up a child on your own but other women managed to do it.""

Then, six years ago, Mandy had problems walking and became disorientated. Her mum took her to another GP, who suggested an HIV test.

A stunned Mandy replied: ""Why? I haven't had sex for 14 years!"" Ben had been the product of a drunken one-night stand when Mandy was a 21-year-old drama student in Portsmouth.

His dad was one of four men she'd had unprotected sex with during her student days. She never saw him again or told him she was pregnant, and she'd not slept with anyone since.

""While Ben was little, I didn't want the complication of bringing a man into his life,"" says Mandy.

""I decided there would be plenty of time for boyfriends later. I was all Ben had.

""Ironically, I was paranoid about catching something terrible by having casual sex and leaving Ben with no one. That hard-hitting Aids tombstone advert, ""Don't die of ignorance"", had haunted me since I'd seen it in the 80s. Now that I was a mum, I wasn't going to take any chances.""

Mandy had the HIV test. ""It was all a blur,"" she recalls. ""I was very confused and couldn't even speak properly. I just remember crying when the doctor said I was HIV positive.""

Doctors admitted Mandy to hospital and she was found to be in the third stage of HIV infection - the final one before it progresses to full-blown Aids.

As doctors treated her with antibiotics and introduced anti-Aids medications, Mandy slowly began to recover.

She says: ""Crazy thoughts like, ""What music should I have at my funeral?"" went through my mind and, ""I hope I don't get those splodges all over my body and look monstrous like an Aids sufferer I once saw in a TV vdocumentary."" The thought terrified me.

""No one knew how I'd caught HIV. I believe it was either from unprotected sex in my youth or from contaminated factor Vlll.""

Although in the 80s many haemophiliacs were infected by HIV through blood treatments, by 1991, when Mandy started having factor-Vlll treatment, blood products were screened. She was told it was unlikely to be the cause.

""Telling Ben that I have HIV was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. He went straight to his room - it still upsets him too much to discuss it,"" she says. Ben, now 20, has shown no signs of HIV.

Mandy decided to be brutally frank with friends and family, telling them she had HIV when they visited her in hospital.

""They were gobsmacked,"" she says. ""Friends have been so supportive and many admit: ""There but for the grace of God..."" I'm proof this can happen to anyone.""

Dependent on her mum to care for her, Mandy left hospital in a wheelchair. After three months, she began to recover and walk again. Today, she has high cholesterol and continuing problems with walking and balance. No one knows yet what permanent damage HIV has had on her. 

""People can live with HIV for up to 25-30 years before manifesting symptoms. I always thought I was weak but I must be tough to survive this long - I've had it for 16 years,"" she says.

Since discovering she has HIV, Mandy's life has been transformed. ""I keep going by setting goals. At first, I was determined to walk again, then I vowed to survive until Ben was 18, then I wanted to get my fine art degree.""

She held her first art exhibition this year and many pieces are inspired by her HIV experiences.

Her next goal is to get an international art exhibition as well as finding a teaching job but, so far, she hasn't reached interview stage. Mandy believes potential employers are put off by her HIV status, which she has to disclose on application forms.

Mandy doesn't hide her HIV. For the past three years she has dyed her blonde hair pink.

""It's part of being proud of who I am - not being ashamed of having HIV,"" she explains.

She's open about it with partners, too - she isn't in a relationship but has slept with two men since her diagnosis.

""They were fine about my HIV,"" she said.

""Of course, we practised safe sex.""

""I'm not unremittingly positive,"" she confesses. ""Sometimes I cry and rail: ""Why me?"" Then I think: ""Why not me?""

""It's World Aids day on Monday and I'm speaking out to try to dispel the myths about HIV and reduce the stigma so that people aren't afraid to go and get tested.

""HIV doesn't discriminate. Don't put it off - get tested today!""",uncertain,training

We've now spoken with one of the victims of the home invasion robbery early this morning -- a man who works for Detail, Akon's producer -- and he says Suge Knight and money are behind the incident.

Christopher Walker tells us at about 3:00 AM five men broke into his home with guns and said they were there to collect a debt on behalf of Suge Knight. They claimed Detail owed Suge money, and then proceeded to collect on the debt.

Walker says Detail was asleep in one of the bedrooms. The men entered the bedroom but did not get Detail out of bed. Instead, they stole $170,000 worth of jewelry from his room. 

Walker adds they demanded a key to the safe and said they would kill all four people in the house if they didn't get it. The robbers didn't get the key -- instead, they took the 130 pound safe. 

Walker says they also took stereo equipment and a key to a Mercedes. He claims the total heist was more than $200,000. A police source tells us it's more like $300,000.

Walker says the feud ignited in Arizona during NBA All-Star weekend when Suge got his face smashed in by two men who worked for Akon. Walker says that incident was over the same alleged debt that triggered this morning's home invasion.

A robber who held up a bookies with his girlfriend's Rampant Rabbit vibrator was jailed today.

Nicki Jex, 27, hid the sex toy in a carrier bag and pretended it was a gun during the raid on the Ladbrokes shop in Leicester, in December of last year.

A member of staff at the branch handed over more than $600 in cash when he pointed it at her, Leicester Crown Court was told.

Jex, of Braunstone, pleaded guilty to the robbery, which was captured by the shop's CCTV.

Sentencing him to five years behind bars, Judge Philip Head said: ""It's right to record that you did not have a firearm but you pretended you had and intended that those you confronted believed that you did, and it must have been truly terrifying for them at the time.""

The CCTV recorded the moment Jex strode into the shop, brandishing the ""firearm"" minutes before staff were due to close for the day.

Tim Palmer, prosecuting, told the court: ""The defendant pointed the item in the carrier bag at the cashier. She immediately assumed it to be a firearm.

""In fact, what was contained within the carrier bag was the defendant's girlfriend's vibrator.""

The cashier went behind the counter and Jex turned the imitation weapon on the bookies' manager, demanding cash.

She handed over $613 in till contents and other money.

But amazingly he ruled that her evidence against a lout she picked out in an ID parade was so compelling it would unfairly sway the jury. He awarded the mum of two $250 for her courage -- but let accused robber Liam Perks, 20, walk free.

376,"Bungling bank robbers caught after using SatNav to plan raids

The gang were locked up for a total of 71 years for a spree of 21 robberies

A key member of a notorious gang of armed robbers was brought to justice because he used his car satnav to check out locations for their bank raids.

Adrian Johnson typed the addresses of 12 banks into his navigation system while planning the robberies - one of which ended in mayhem when two of his fellow gang members were shot dead by police.

When he was caught during a final raid staged ""in memory"" of one of the dead robbers, police computer experts used his TomTom satnav as crucial evidence to link him to previous hold-ups.

The gang were locked up for a total of 71 years for a spree of 21 robberies in which they beat up security guards at gunpoint as they made off with $500,000. Flying Squad Detective Inspector Terry Wilson, who led the investigation, said: ""What nailed Johnson was that the banks that were robbed were typed into the satnav's 'places of interest' feature.

""There is no better evidence when you arrest somebody for a linked series of robberies at locations across the country and it was beyond our expectations.""

The gang made headlines last year when two were shot dead during an attempted robbery in Chandler's Ford, Hants, after police put them under surveillance.

Gang leader Mark Nunes was gunned down as he held a pistol to a security guard's head while Andrew Markland was shot by a sniper as he tried to pick up the gun.

Johnson had used his satnav to go on reconnaissance missions to the robbery targets. The system was then used in the gang's getaway car to guide them back to London.

The satnav was seized from his girlfriend's car following his arrest two months after the Chandler's Ford shootings.

He tried to explain away the satnav record by claiming he had been visiting other girlfriends in each of the towns.

But the TomTom showed Johnson had been to 12 robbery locations.

Detectives also analysed mobile phone traces to show conspirators had been at the scenes in the weeks before the robberies. The gang targeted Group 4 security vans used to take money to High Street banks. They picked vehicles on low-security routes that they knew were not equipped with cash boxes that belch out coloured smoke or dye.

They also chose targets outside London to escape Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, which solves 50 per cent of cash-in-transit robberies.

By last year police had the gang under surveillance and were waiting for them in Chandler's Ford on the morning of September 13.

After the two robbers were shot, getaway driver Terry Wallace managed to escape. Two months later Johnson - who was not involved in the previous robbery but helped with planning - joined in his last raid at a Lloyds TSB in Colchester, Essex, ""in memory"" of shot Nunes.

When he was caught, police had enough evidence to arrest the rest of the gang. They found a pistol in Johnson's garage along with $$8,000 from the Colchester raid.

The arrests sent shockwaves through the underworld, cutting the country's cash-in-transit robberies by 15 per cent at a stroke.

Johnson, 28, and getaway driver Wallace, 26, were jailed for 17 years each. Other gang members got five to 12 years.",uncertain,training

Tony and Doreen Lofthouse, who made millions from the throat lozenges Fisherman's Friend, were confronted by burglars at their home near Blackpool, Lancashire, on Friday night.

Lancashire Police said the couple, ranked 491st in the 2008 Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of $165 million, were left in shock after being locked in a room during the raid.

""Thankfully neither of them was seriously injured, but the male occupant was taken to Blackpool Hospital for a welfare check.""

Police were called to the house, in Thornton Cleveleys, just before 8am yesterday.

The robbery is believed to have taken place at around 9.30pm on Friday when the two offenders, who had East European accents, forced their way inside and confronted the couple.

The Lofthouses, who are both in their 70s, were locked in a room while their home was searched.

Detectives said the exact list of property stolen remains unclear but a small quantity of cash and items jewellery are thought to have been taken.

The incident has been described by police as a ""high value"" robbery.

Mr Oldham added: ""This is clearly a premeditated and carefully planned robbery so I would also appeal to anyone that saw anything suspicious in the days or weeks leading up to the robbery to call police with any information they think could be significant.""

Police believe the men fled the property about 10pm but it is not known in which direction they went or if any vehicle was used as part of their escape.

The first offender is described as being of a stocky build and approximately 5ft 5ins tall.

He was wearing a balaclava with a red diamond pattern on the front on his forehead.

The second offender is taller, around 5ft 10ins or 5ft 11ins and is described as slim build and was also wearing a balaclava.

Aveline Hardaker, a spokeswoman for Lyttelton police station, Centurion, said the woman was woken up by a noise at the house, in the Rietvalleipark area, at about 3.15am local time.

She said: ""She saw three men in her bedroom. One of them was armed with a firearm.

""They indicated to her to be quiet. She immediately started to scream and one of the men put his finger into her mouth to stop her from screaming.

""Her uncle, a 52-year-old male who was visiting from Cardiff, then entered the bedroom and took her from the man who was trying to keep her quiet.

""They were then told to sit down.""

The woman's baby, who had started crying in another room, was brought into the bedroom by one of the robbers and handed to Mr Peters, while the other men searched the bedroom.

Mr Peters' wife then entered the bedroom and was also told to sit on the bed, Mrs Hardaker said.

""The men repeatedly told them to keep quiet in English and Afrikaans and demanded the key to the safe,"" she said. ""Her uncle told the men to take what they wanted and not to hurt them.

""The men then demanded the keys to her Mercedes Benz, which she gave to them.

""Her uncle got up from where he was sitting. He was fatally wounded by one of the men.""

After the shooting, the robbers tied up the other adults with shoe laces and tied belts around their mouths before continuing to search the woman's bedroom, asking where their mobile phones were kept.

They turned the lights off and left the home in the Mercedes Benz with a mobile phone and computer. They then returned to ask the 28-year-old how to put the car in reverse as she was struggling to free herself.

Mrs Hardaker said: ""The man wanted to know what she was doing and she told him that she was trying to assist her baby who was lying on the floor.

""He then left again and she managed to untie herself and call for help.""

Police in South Africa are now investigating the murder, robbery and theft of the car.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm the death of a British national in Pretoria.

""Consular staff in South Africa are in contact with the family and are providing consular assistance.""  

Mr Peters was in South Africa to say goodbye to his terminally-ill sister-in-law, BBC Online reported.

The website said she is suffering from cancer and Mr Peters had travelled from Wales to visit her.

It named his wife as Anne Peters, and his niece, who has a four-month-old baby, as Siobhan Forman.

Mrs Forman told the website: ""Can you imagine what we are going through? My mother is dying of cancer, my uncle came to visit under these sad circumstances, and now he is murdered.

""Life is very, very unfair. Why? What for? They could have taken anything, anything. What is this country coming to?""

She said her uncle arrived in South Africa a week ago, and stayed with her parents before visiting her on Tuesday.

Mrs Forman said the robbers entered the house through her baby son's bedroom window before going into her room.

She added: ""They killed a man for nothing. They didn't even take much. He just came to say goodbye.""

Mr Peters' body will be flown home after a post-mortem examination has been carried out.

The death follows the fatal shooting of fellow Welshman Fred Picton-Turbervill in Pretoria in January.

The 46-year-old father-of-six, originally from Ewenny, near Bridgend, was killed in front of his wife and children by armed robbers who stole a laptop, mobile phones and cash.

No arrests have yet been made, but the Mercedes was later recovered, Mrs Hardaker said.

She added that nobody else was hurt, and that Mr Peters had handed the baby to his wife before he was shot.",uncertain,test

Star's boy put pistol to man's head

Ex-Corrie star Kevin Kennedy's son has been jailed for eight-and-a-half years after holding a gun to a man's head in a terrifying hold-up.

Ryan Williams, 21, whose father played Curly Watts in the soap, fled with more than $1,000 following the vicious robbery at a drive-thru McDonald's.

Williams, who claimed in court he was bullied at school because of his father's fame, denied being the robber but admitted being in debt to a drugs gang.

Yesterday his shocked father washed his hands of his wayward son by first wife Dawn. Kevin, 47, who played gormless Curly for two decades before he was axed five years ago, said he had no idea his son was in trouble because the two are estranged. He said: ""I didn't know about this. It's a shock. I haven't had anything to do with Ryan since he was 14. I tried to help when I could but he didn't want it.""

Manchester Crown Court heard how dad-of two Williams, of Warrington, Cheshire, fled with the cash after the hold up at McDonald's in Chorlton, Manchester.

Lookout Mark Greaves, 21, of Chorlton, was jailed for six-and-a-half years but Williams was described as the instigator.

The court heard how a handgun, which turned out to be fake, was pushed through a glass hatch at the drive-thru. Williams held the gun to a worker's temple before grabbing the cash.

The judge told Williams: ""The victim must have been terrified.""

Kevin, now in panto Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs in London, said he had cut off contact with his son after he tried to sell a false story about him to a newspaper.

""Eventually there comes a time when you just have to let go. I haven't spoken to him in years,"" he said.

Kevin, who lives with second wife Clare and their two daughters, battled alcoholism for years.

He added: ""Ryan's got himself addicted to something. There's not a great deal I can do about it.""",uncertain,training

389,"EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Neighbor Saw Phillip Garrido's Mother Driving Car Used In Kidnap; Talked To Child In Yard

A neighbor of accused kidnapper Phillip Garrido has come forward with two new crucial pieces of information about the abduction and 18-year imprisonment of Jaycee Dugard.

In an exclusive video interview, Polly White reveals that she met a child last year who is almost certainly Jaycee's daughter, Starlet. And, contradicting previous reports that said Garrido's mother was infirm at the time of the kidnapping, Polly tells that she saw Patricia Garrido driving the same car that was used to kidnap Jaycee!

Polly has lived in the house next to Garrido's for 33 years. Her home is approximately 200 feet from the kidnapper's. She told that last summer she was in the backyard and there was a board missing from a fence between the homes.

""A little girl kinda popped up there and I said, ""Hi honey. How are you?"" And she said, ""fine."" And I asked her how old she was and she said 10,"" Polly told. Poly then asked the little girl if she'd like to come over to play with her grandson some time but the girl ran off. The fence was boarded up the next day.

Jaycee's daughter Starlet is 11, fitting the age of the girl Polly saw last summer in Garrido's yard.

Jaycee, Starlet and her other daughter Angel, 15, were held in a backyard prison compound of sheds and tents by Garrido and his wife Nancy. Garrido's mother Patricia lived with them for many years and some press reports have quoted the now 88-year-old as saying she thought Jaycee was Garrido's daughter by a previous relationship. Those same reports have portrayed Patricia as having been infirm during the entire time Jaycee was at the house.

But Polly told a story that drastically contradicts that assertion and raises stark questions about what Patricia may have known. She reveals that she met Patricia, who asked Polly's husband to cut down a tree on the property. And far from being infirm, ""she (Patricia) was driving the car that they hauled off that they said had been used to kidnap Jaycee,"" Polly told.",uncertain,training

The twin brother of missing Ilene Misheloff opens up exclusively about his family's ongoing search to find his sister and how they are working with police about the possible involvement of Phillip Garrido. Investigators are probing possible links in the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard in 1991 and the disappearance of Misheloff who went missing close to her school in Dublin, California in 1989 when she was 13.

""The police have spoken to my parents Mike and Maddi about the case but we want them to comment on the investigation. There are similarities and we have never given-up hope of finding Ilene who went missing over 20 years ago now,"" Brian Miselhoff, 34, said.

Police are also looking into the abduction of Michaela Garecht in 1988 who disappeared from Hayward, California, when she was 9.

""We are delighted that Jaycee has been re-united with her family because it is unimaginably painful experience to go through what we and many others have endured,"" he added. ""For me the Garrido's are the most horrible people imaginable and I don't know what I would say to them if we ever came face to face - but I hope they are helping the investigators if they know anything about Ilene and the other girl Michaela Garecht who went missing around the same time.""

Misheloff admits that he has struggled to come to terms with the loss of his twin sister and that he thinks about her each day. The single payroll officer still has fond memories of his twin and admits that it has been very hard for him to move-on with his life since that fateful day in 1989.

""Ilene and I would argue and fight a lot when we were growing-up but she was the closest friend I had,"" he revealed. ""She would never have done anything to hurt anybody but was very driven too and her great passion was ice-skating. It's been so difficult for my family since she went missing and especially for my parents who have been married for 38 years.""

Being twins magnifies that pain: ""I think about my sister a lot and especially being a twin birthdays are really hard because you think of what she is missing-out on.

Garecht was snatched close to a grocery store after she and a friend went there on their scooters. Her mother Sharon Murch spoke at a news conference outside the Garrido's home in Antioch, California, where they reportedly held Dugard in their backyard for 18 years.

""I know if Jaycee Dugard can be found alive and come home after 18 years then my daughter can be found alive and can come home,"" she said. ""I have heard that neighbors reported to the police several years ago that there were girls living in the backyard at the Garrido house, and they didn't say there were three girls living in the backyard - they said there were five. And the age ranges they gave could've included Jaycee and her girls among the younger ones, and perhaps the older one that they saw might have been Michaela.""",uncertain,test

Peter Haining, 28, was jailed for 12-and-a-half-years, David Smith, 37, for five years and three months, while Ian Rosales, 19, was given three years. They are all from Heywood, Greater Manchester.

Leslie White, 65, of Craigavon, Co Armagh, was given a six-year sentence, and Craig Adams, 23, of Bury, was jailed for four years and 10 months.

Passing sentence at the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Hodge told the defendants the kidnapping of the shopkeeper had been a ""very serious criminal enterprise"" which led to a ""stressful and prolonged deal"" for Mr Mukhtar and his family.

Devout Muslim Mr Mukhtar, 58, was seized from his family home in the Crossmyloof area of the city during Ramadan on September 29 last year.

The armed gang bundled him into a van before driving him, handcuffed and hooded, 200 miles to the Heywood area where he was moved around three flats in a 25-day ordeal.

The gang made ransom demands from public phone boxes to their captive's family home and shop in Rutherglen, near Glasgow.

The man accused of kidnapping Shannon Matthews was charged with the abduction of one of his daughters 15 months earlier, a jury was told today.

Michael Donovan was involved in a custody dispute over his two daughters and took one of them on a trip to Blackpool in November 2006, Leeds Crown Court heard.

However, the charges were later dropped when the matter got to court.

The court was told he was married to a woman called Susan Bird, and they had two daughters before the relationship broke down and ended in divorce.

Earlier Donovan told the jury he was ""scared"" of Shannon's mum Karen Matthews.

Donovan and Matthews, 33, deny kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.

His barrister Alan Conrad QC asked him: ""How do you feel towards Karen? Do you like her?""

He replied: ""No.""

Asked why, he went on: ""I'm scared of her. She kept threatening me.""

Donovan, 40, of Batley Carr, West Yorkshire, went into the witness box after the trial was halted yesterday so he could get treatment for injuries he received in a prison attack.

Last week the court heard loner Donovan told detectives Karen frightened him into taking part in the attempted sting.

He alleged she warned he would be beaten up if he refused to snatch Shannon -- and she would have him killed if he told anyone.

Donovan claimed Karen always knew where her daughter was in the 24 days she was missing.

Today Mr Conrad began by asking Donovan about his criminal record.

He confirmed he was convicted of arson and shoplifting when he was 11-years-old and criminal damage when he was 16.

The court heard that, more recently, he had accepted police cautions for attempting to obtain property, namely medicine, by deception.

He also agreed he went to a special school when he was younger because ""I have difficulties with all sorts of things"".

Donovan confirmed he liked driving but had more than 100 lessons before he passed his driving test on the second attempt.

The jury was also told that Donovan was injured in a road accident in 1991 when his van overturned on the M62 in West Yorkshire.

He said he met his future wife, Ms Bird, when he was having psychiatric counselling after his injury.

He told the jury the relationship had problems.

Donovan said: ""She was right violent towards me. She tried to control me.""

He confirmed he took a range of drugs for his various problems, including Temazepam, but denied ever taking heroin.

Donovan told the jury that Matthews flagged him down while he was driving in Dewsbury.

She told him she had a ""problem"" and wanted him to sort it out. He claimed she said: ""I don't want anyone else to know about it.""

They agreed to meet at a cafe in Dewsbury a few days later, the jury was told.

Donovan also told the court that Matthews asked him for a loan of $20,000.

Mr Conrad asked him: ""Did you have that money?""

""No, I didn't,"" he replied.

Mr Conrad then asked him if he would have loaned her the money if he had it.

The dramatic moment when police found Shannon Matthews hidden under a bed has been described in court.

Cops who were first on the scene where the little girl was being kept told how she emerged frightened and crying from the hidey-hole.

And they were forced to deny claims kidnap suspect Michael Donovan was roughed up as he was dragged out of the flat she was in.

DC Paul Kettlewell said police were searching the defendant's flat in Batley Carr, West Yorkshire, when they heard a child's voice.

He said the voice said: ""Stop it, you're frightening me.""

The officer went on: ""Then I went into the bedroom. My colleague turned towards me and, as I was beginning to think perhaps the voice came from inside the bed, there was a noise inside the bed as a small girl started to emerge.""

He described how other officers passed the nine-year-old to him.

DC Kettlewell told the court: ""She was frightened and she was crying.""

Another cop, PC Ian Mosley, told the jury it was ""quite surreal"" when Shannon emerged from the bed.

He said: ""We were not expecting to find Shannon.""

In cross-examination, PC Mosley denied that police had roughed up Donovan when they found him in the bedroom.

Alan Conrad QC, for Donovan, said to PC Mosley: ""A number of you banged his head against the floor, another officer kneeled on his thigh, all the time shouting at him 'Now we've got you'.

""On the way out, his head was banged against the wall, wasn't it?""

PC Mosley replied: ""No, sir.""

Another officer, PC Matthew Troake, told the jury that Donovan said to him, ""Get Karen down here, we've got a plan"" in the police van after his arrest.

The officer said Donovan went on: ""We're sharing the money - $50,000.""

PC Troake told how he had earlier found Donovan in the bed after Shannon had been taken from the bedroom.

He said: ""I looked down into the hole where she'd come from and I saw a man, who I now know to be Michael Donovan, looking back at me.

""He was laid facing me in a foetal position.""

PC Troake said he arrested Donovan and told him to come out but he did not respond.

After Donovan again failed to move or respond, he lifted the bed and pulled him out.

The officer told the jury: ""I do remember he was screaming at the time.""

He said Donovan tried to bite another officer and had to be carried into the police van.

Earlier, tearful telly appeals made by the mum of Shannon as she begged for help to find her daughter were played in court.

Footage of Karen Matthews, 33, was shown to jurors as her trial for the kidnap of the youngster - in an alleged bid to collect reward money - resumed.

The trial was halted yesterday after it emerged Donovan, 40, needed more medical treatment after he was punched to the ground by a lag in prison at the weekend.

Today the judge Mr Justice McCombe said: ""Following an X-ray Mr Donovan has been found to have suffered a fractured jaw.

""Hopefully well-treatable. He was in pain and unable to take some food.

""Surgery is not now required and he's been given some suitable food in addition to painkillers.""

Matthews and Donovan both deny kidnapping and falsely imprisoning Shannon, now ten, who went missing in February.

They also deny perverting the course of justice.

Leeds Crown Court has heard how Shannon was found in Donovan's flat 24 days after she went missing from her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks.

It is alleged Donovan kept her drugged and imprisoned in his flat nearby as part of a plan he and Matthews hatched to rake in $50,000 in reward money offered by The Sun.

The longest survivor of a child kidnapping is Austrian Natascha Kampusch - found eight years after she vanished.

Natascha was 10 when she was snatched in 1998 by Wolfgang Priklopil, 36, and held in an underground cell.

She escaped in 2006 and Priklopil committed suicide by throwing himself under a train.

Natascha, who is still receiving counselling, said later she felt sorry for him.

In 1999, 10-year-olds Charlene Lunnon and Lisa Hoodless were found alive after being held for three days by paedophile Alan Hopkinson in St Leonards, East Sussex.

Hopkinson forced them to watch TV news bulletins about their plight and repeatedly threatened to kill them.

They were rescued when cops arrived at his flat to quiz him over an unrelated offence.

399,"Man admits kidnapping nurse Magdeline Makola and leaving her tied up in car boot

A man today admitted abducting a nurse and leaving her tied up in the boot of a car.

Magdeline Makola, 38, of Livingston, West Lothian, spent days locked in the boot before she was found by police on Boxing Day last year.

Today, at the High Court in Edinburgh, Justice Ngema, 35, pleaded guilty to abducting the nurse, tying her up and placing her in the boot of the car.

Ms Makola had not been seen since she left work at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on December 15.

Concerns were initially raised when the South African-born nurse failed to turn up for her shift on December 18 and she was reported missing.

An investigation was launched and Ms Makola was discovered by police in the red Vauxhall Astra in the town of Airdrie, Lanarkshire.

Her brother Refilwe Makola, 35, flew from his home in South Africa to be with his sister while she was being treated in hospital.

Ms Makola arrived at court this morning to hear the guilty plea.

The court heard that Ngema, who is also known as Sifiso Praise God Ngema, had entered the country using his brother's passport - despite being deported in 2002 after a failed claim for asylum.

Advocate-depute Alex Prentice said Ngema made numerous appearances at his victim's flat before finally subjecting her to her ordeal.

The court heard that Ngema invited himself in to her home and asked for a drink.

When Ms Makola turned around shortly afterwards, Ngema grabbed her with both hands around her neck and said: ""I'm a professional in this job, I kill people, you shut up right now.""

He threatened her with a knife and forced her to lie down in her hallway.

The court heard that Ms Makola - who sat in court today - believed she was going to be raped.

Her attacker punched her and bound her and used force to obtain her bank pin codes.

Ms Makola was punched in the head and then carried over Ngema's shoulder to her car at the start of a journey which would take her on a disorienting tour without food or water before she was finally found on Boxing Day.

During the terrifying ordeal, the court heard, Ngema used his victim's bank card to go on a shopping spree, including trips with his girlfriend, buying goods in ""designer shops"" in the run-up to Christmas.

He bought champagne and visited bars in Glasgow while ""duping"" his friend and ex-girlfriend's family.

Meanwhile, the court heard, Ms Makola was bound and gagged in the boot of her own car in temperatures from 6C to sub-zero. She never saw where she was but guessed she was taken to an airport, railway station and along the M8 motorway.

The court heard how she was forced to urinate in the car and began losing consciousness.

Mr Prentice said: ""One day it was quiet and she heard no footsteps. She believed it was Christmas. She did not kick out at the boot on that day.""

When police found her on December 26 she was in severe pain.

Mr Prentice said: ""She was screaming from the pain. She was trying to drink from a straw but the water was too cold.""

Detective Constable Kevin Huliston, a family liaison officer with Lothian and Borders Police, later read a statement on behalf of Ms Makola outside court.

It said: ""When I was taken I did not think I was going to survive and the experience of being trapped is one that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

""While I was in the boot of the car it was difficult for me to work out how long I had been there, but one of my strongest memories is realising that it was Christmas Day because it was so quiet outside.

""I have a strong faith in God and I spent a lot of time praying that someone would find me.

""Praying gave me a lot of strength and when the policeman opened the door I was so happy that my prayers had been answered.

""I am pleased that Justice Ngema has pleaded guilty today and I want people to know that I feel no anger towards him, only pity. I wish him well in the future and I will pray for him.""

Detective Inspector Alan Sommerville, who led the investigation into Ms Makola's disappearance, also welcomed the outcome of today's case.

""We are satisfied with the guilty plea that was tendered today, which will hopefully be of some comfort to Magdeline and allow her to get on with her life following what was a terrifying ordeal.

""It is clear that Justice Ngema is a manipulative individual, motivated by his own greed, and it is typical of his character that he has shown no remorse for his actions.

""Ngema was not well-known to Magdeline and the pair had only met briefly through a mutual acquaintance some years previously.

""Magdeline, however, is a woman motivated by her strong desire to help people and on this occasion she fell victim to a man who had no qualms about taking advantage of her caring nature.""

Mr Sommerville added that the plea came as a result of a ""comprehensive report presented to prosecutors"".

""At this time we want to praise Magdeline for the strength and courage she has shown both during her ordeal and throughout her recovery,"" he said.

""She is a remarkable individual.""",uncertain,training
400,"Karen Matthews trial: Jury sworn in for mum charged with kidnapping daughter Shannon

A jury was today sworn in for the trial of the mum of schoolgirl Shannon Matthews who went missing for 24 days earlier this year.

Karen Matthews, 33, and co-defendant Michael Donovan, 40, deny kidnapping and falsely imprisoning Shannon, who was nine at the time of the alleged offences.

The two have also pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice.

Shannon disappeared on February 19, sparking a massive search operation by West Yorkshire Police which became one of the highest-profile missing person inquiries ever seen in Britain.

She was found less than a mile from her home on Moorside Road, Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire, 24 days after she vanished.

Donovan, of Lidgate Gardens, Batley Carr, was arrested on the day she was found.

Formerly known as Paul Drake, he is the uncle of Matthews's ex-partner, Craig Meehan.

As the jury of seven men and five women was sworn at Leeds Crown Court, Matthews and Donovan sat a few seats apart in the dock separated by a woman security officer.

Matthews was wearing a beige jacket over a white blouse and wore her long, red hair untied over her shoulders.

Donovan, who has short, dark hair, was wearing a dark blue jumper and blue jeans.

The potential jurors were asked a number of questions, including whether they had been involved in the search for Shannon.

The judge, Mr Justice McCombe, also asked them whether they lived in Dewsbury or a number of other places in the Dewsbury area.

They were then asked if they had any connections with organisations including the police, the Courts Service and the Crown Prosecution Service.",uncertain,training
401,"Jaycee Lee Dugard accused Phillip Garrido gave tips to stop kidnapping

Sex beast Phillip Garrido once dished out tips on preventing child abduction, it was revealed last night.

Child safety advocate Janice Gomes said she unwittingly hired the paedophile's printing business to produce an advice leaflet for families to prevent kidnapping.

This emerged as Jaycee Lee Dugard's family released pictures of their daughter before her ordeal at the hands of Garrido.

Janice said: ""He said, ""Children really shouldn't be walking to the bus stop by themselves. They're no match for adults"".""

Garrido is accused of abducting Jaycee, then 11, as she waited for a school bus in 1991 and holding her hostage for 18 years.

Janice said Garrido had told her during a phone chat in 2000 children were no safer with their friends.

Janice said: ""He said, ""If an adult approaches a group, they all scatter and you just grab one"".""

Last night police in Antioch, California disclosed Garrido, then aged 21, was arrested in 1972 on suspicion of raping a girl of 14.

It was the terrifying call Dimitar Berbatov has feared since becoming a major soccer star.

Mafia mobsters threatened to snatch the $30million Manchester United ace's wife Elena and newborn baby daughter Dea unless he handed over $500,000.

The 28-year-old Bulgarian striker was so scared he fled his country immediately with his family after striking a deal with the gang. And Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson is believed to have sanctioned a private charter jet to fly them back to England.

One family friend said: ""Dimi is still very worried for his family and has promised his neighbours money if they notice any suspicious people around his house.""

Berbatov, who was kidnapped as an 18-year-old by the boss of a rival football team, had been back home in Sofia with Elena and little Dea when mob bosses are said to have contacted his mother Margarita with their kidnap threat 10 days ago.

He is believed to have refused to tell the police after underworld sources told him officials from Bulgaria's Internal Affairs ministry were in on the plot.

It is also understood the star negotiated a deal with gang bosses who agreed to leave his family alone.

But United have beefed up security at his home in England. A club spokesman said last night: ""As this is a security matter we have no comment to make.""

Berbatov's first kidnap ordeal came when he was a rising star at CSKA Sofia. According to a book, confirmed by the player, he was snatched after training by three henchmen of feared gangland chief Georgi Iliev.

The thug was said to be determined to force him to sign for his club Levski Kjustendil. But as he was being taken to meet Iliev, Berbatov managed to make a frantic call to his dad Ivan who intervened and thrashed out a deal.

Soccer ace Lomana LuaLua has a secret lovechild living in poverty, The Sun can reveal.

The Premiership striker earns $18,000 a week, drives a Mercedes 4x4 and blows a fortune on clothes and jewellery.

But his three-year-old son and the child's mum Mimita Bofando live on benefits in a grim tower block plagued by muggers and junkies.

Singer Mimita, 22, said last night: ""We've been so poor I've gone without food to make sure my son can eat.

""It makes my blood boil to see Lomana swanning around in his Mercedes with his flashy clothes. Whenever I pluck up the courage to ask him for help he swears that he's flat broke.

Mimita -- born in The Congo like LuaLua -- met the star in a nightclub. He was playing for Colchester before moving to Newcastle United.

LuaLua, now on loan to Portsmouth, played the dutiful dad when the baby, who The Sun is not naming, arrived in February 2001. He chose the baby's second name and put his name on the birth certificate.

But Mimita claims he has only visited his son a few times and has failed to send regular cash to support him.

She added: ""He's only ever given me the odd $300 or $500, then won't give me another penny for months.

Mimita said she has only received $5,000 in total and is now hiring lawyers to get the star to support them.

She gets $92 a week benefit to cover bills, food, clothes and the $10 rent on her council flat in Barking, East London.

LuaLua, who wears a $7,000 Jacob & Co watch, insisted last night that he makes regular monthly payments to Mimita.

406,"EXCLUSIVE: Bill Nighy On Poverty.. And Passion

""Sex God? No. I think I'm more the drinking woman's crumpet,"" says Love Actually star.

The sheer numbers took Bill Nighy's breath away - and made an unforgettable impression on the Love Actually star.

He simply had no idea that in Africa a child dies of poverty or disease every three seconds.

So he was glad of the chance to support the international drive to tackle the crisis facing millions of people there.

But Nighy's appearance tomorrow in a TV film backing the Make Poverty History campaign is not just a propaganda trip.

It looks like having the unlikely side-effect of making the Bafta-winning veteran a sex symbol at the age of 55.

There's passion among the politics in The Girl In The Cafe, with Nighy as a shy civil servant who falls in love with a much younger girl.

The topical BBC1 special - written by Love Actually's Richard Curtis - highlights the ease with which a fictional G8 group of world leaders could end the plight of millions of Africans if they had the will.

Nighy hopes that the film - which has been sold around the world and will air in the US the same day - will make millions aware of the crisis.

He says he was horrified to learn the facts and glad to feel he could help in some way. ""I simply didn't know that 50,000 people died in Africa every day and that 30,000 of them are children. I had no idea.

""I haven't suddenly become an expert on international affairs and I haven't suddenly got more compassion than anybody else. But I've been given the opportunity to do something that might help as part of a larger campaign,"" he says.

""You can hardly think about these statistics - they are so breathtaking. Every three seconds. I didn't know those numbers.""

The movie delivers a timely message, but Nighy hopes viewers will also enjoy it as a good piece of drama.

It's all part of Bob Geldof's plan to influence the people who could make a difference to Africa. When the real G8 conference is held in Gleneagles, Scotland, next month, the Boomtown Rats frontman is hoping to attract a million people to converge on Edinburgh and hammer the point home.

Nighy has been won over by the cause. ""These eight men in one room - as my character says in the film - could literally save hundreds of millions of lives,"" he says, warming to his theme.

""If this was happening in a different continent I don't know that we'd tolerate plans that took a few days, because we'd have lost another 250,000 people. Would we sit around that long?

""So why do we let it go on in Africa? Everything that's needed is available, it's there and it's never not been there. They need medicine, they need food and they need money.

""A few phone calls and they could stop it happening. This is not some sort of amateur proposal - it has been really carefully worked out by first-rate professionals. I am reliably informed, by people cleverer than me, that there is actually no obstacle.""

Nighy stars alongside Kelly Macdonald, who plays the girl who causes problems by infiltrating the leaders' conference and asking all the right questions about the stricken continent. It is the latest starring role for an actor who is perplexed to find that his career is at an all-time high.

After stealing the show as an ageing rocker in Love Actually, he is busy filming two sequels to Hollywood blockbuster Pirates Of The Caribbean back-to-back.

""I should think that more people saw me in Love Actually than have seen me in everything else I've ever done in my whole life,"" he says. ""People are fond of old rockers - they are our kind of pioneers and we have great affection for them.""

Having recently proclaimed that he'd never ""get the girl"" again on screen because it wasn't commercially viable, he was amazed to find himself involved in this latest love story.

""I'm a bit long in the tooth for all that, but for once it was essential to the plot that I am a man who is knocking on a bit because it makes me more vulnerable,"" he says.

Modest to a fault, Nighy can't believe that anyone would consider him a sex symbol.

""I certainly don't feel like one, that's for sure. It must be the parts I've played.

""Somebody once introduced me as the thinking woman's crumpet and it reminded me of the time someone said that to Christopher Walken and he replied: ""Is that some sort of bagel?"", which I thought was very cool. ""I think I'm more the drinking woman's crumpet.""

Women regularly approach him in the street. ""I think they should all seek help, psychiatric help. I can't tell you what they say - it's too embarrassing,"" he laughs.

But fans should count themselves lucky that Nighy ever made it into acting to give such sterling performances in the likes of State Of Play, Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and Shaun Of The Dead.

As a teenager he was a hopeless romantic with a head full of Bob Dylan and Ernest Hemingway. When he was ""unexpectedly released"" from school at the age of 15 after flunking his exams, he ran off to Paris to write the great English novel.

""When I left I threw my suitcase out of the window. I could have used the front door, but it didn't have the same ring to it. I was a complete mess as a boy - full of nonsense,"" he sighs. Needless to say, the book never happened and he begged from American tourists for several months before coming home.

A plan to become a journalist fell by the wayside when he was turned down by his local paper, the Croydon Advertiser, for not having the requisite five O-levels (he's got two). But it probably wouldn't have been the right job for him anyway.

""I had visions of wearing a mac and a hat and interviewing beautiful women in the rain in Yugoslavia. I'm sure a lot of that goes on,"" he laughs. But not, perhaps, in Croydon.

He got into acting by chance. His first girlfriend was going to drama school and so Nighy thought he'd go with her.

""If she'd said astronaut I'd have written to Cape Canaveral,"" he confesses. But then came the auditions. Thinking he'd be clever, Nighy tried to pick one male part and one female. ""I did Eliza Doolittle from Pygmalion and for my boy I did Cesario from Twelfth Night - a girl dressed up as a boy.

""When I'd finished, the man asked me why I'd done two women's parts and I had no idea that I had. Thankfully, they gave me a second chance and I got in.

""I'm proud to be an actor. All I do is fanny around and get paid for it. I've been lucky with the gigs I've had and I've met some of the most remarkable people, including my wife.""

In fact Nighy and Diana Quick, his partner of 23 years - who live in North London with their actress daughter Mary, 20 - are not married.

""No one got married in my day,"" Nighy explains. ""It's fashionable again now and you have to if you have children because of the tax laws."" So, with Mary in mind, he'll be walking up the aisle sometime himself, then? ""Er, I don't know,"" he replies, smiling.

Bill is not keen to talk about the famous wild boozing he did in his youth. Suffice it to say he's been teetotal for 12 years and finds it ""fabulous"".

An addictive personality, he has also managed to kick fags and coffee, but is currently fighting a losing battle against cans of Coke.

""I remain in caffeine management because I gave up coffee only recently - which was a big thing - so I now drink about eight gallons of tea,"" he reveals.

""I do tend to become fully committed to whatever is the latest amusement aid.""",uncertain,training

Former Scary Spice Mel B says she knows how the Government can tackle poverty in Britain.

In an exclusive interview with the Mirror, the outspoken singer claims some of the poorest people in society have been left feeling ""abandoned"".

She said: ""The Government have got to admit there's a massive problem here. We need to work together to change things.""

Mel was speaking out after spending a week on a run-down council estate in her native Leeds for an ITV documentary, 7 Days On The Breadline.

The show saw Mel looking after five kids, aged six, eight, 12, 16 and 18, on a budget of just $264 a week.

She said: ""I did it to make a point and show that just because you're a celebrity, you can live on benefits. But even I was shocked by the scale of what I saw.""

Things reached a head when she was surrounded in a park by a teenage gang, screaming: ""What the f*** are you doing on a council estate?""

But despite the abuse, Mel feels nothing but sympathy for the many kids forced to roam the streets. And she hopes her experiences send out a message to No10. She said: ""The Government doesn't seem to be trying to find out how to help people in council estates.

""Give them a community centre or at least something for the kids to do to enrich their lives.

""The kids are bored and that always leads to trouble. Whether it's a library, somewhere to play basketball or take a computer course. Give them a sense of achievement. The kids just resorted to hanging about or wasting away watching TV. It was really sad.""",uncertain,test
408,"Stephen Gately was the nice guy of pop who overcame poverty and prejudice

He was the sweet-natured, blue-eyed boy who escaped a life of poverty to become one of the world's biggest popstars.

In the 15 years since Boyzone burst on the scene, Stephen Gately gained a name as one of the nicest guys in the business and won fans for his determination to succeed.

And his brave decision to tell the world he was gay in 1999 helped destroy prejudices and paved the way for other performers to come out.

His death at the age of 33 is a tragic end to a life filled with promise. The second of five siblings, Stephen grew up in the tough, working class

Sheriff Street area in Dublin.

Dad Martin was a decorator and mum Margaret a part-time cleaner,  money was tight and the family couldn't afford luxuries.

Stephen and his friends would chop wooden palettes into kindling and sell it for 10p a bag.

But he never used his background as a sob story, recalling: ""There was a lot of poverty and crime. It was a tough and rough area but nice people and good community spirit.""

He once described having to wear shoes to school with so many holes in the soles, they were stuffed with cardboard to keep rain out. For a time he had to share a bed with his sister. In a 2001 he told of ""brilliant"" holidays with 300 other local kids in a huge communal house. But Stephen was destined to leave Sheriff Street.

He joined a modelling agency and from age 13 he would practice signing his autograph over and over again. He excelled at drama and was a willing churchgoer - as he loved singing.

While Stephen would look back on that life with affection, he wanted to escape it. The way out came in 1993 when he saw and advert that changed his life. Louis Walsh was holding auditions for a boyband to rival reigning heart-throbs Take That.

Stephen, Ronan Keating, Mikey Graham, Shane Lynch and Keith Duffy, beat 400 others and Boyzone scored their first UK hit next year with Love Me For A Reason shooting in at No 2. Sixteen top five singles followed and three No1 studio albums.

The flash, glitzy lifestyle was a world away from everything he knew.

For years Stephen dodged questions about his lovelife. He had known he was gay since his teens and his family, friends and bandmates knew, but he didn't feel ready to come out publicly.

Then in 1999 an ex-Boyzone guard threatened to reveal all. In a corner, Stephen, who was in a relationship with Dutch boyband singer Eloy de Jong, decided to tell the truth himself.

He later said: ""For years, I had to hide my sexuality. Eloy and I would take different cars, different planes, check into our hotel at different times. And all those questions that you had to dodge: ""Who's your favourite girl?"", ""Which girls do you fancy?"" What a weight it was off my shoulders.""

But mum Margaret viewed it rather differently and told the newspapers: ""What has happened is blackmail. Stephen's been bullied into doing this.""

He was reportedly furious she spoke to the press and it sparked a long feud. Last year, Stephen admitted the row was his biggest regret and he was very thankful they patched it up.

Stephen had a painful break-up with Eloy in 2002, then in 2003 he was introduced by Elton John and David Furnish to businessman Andrew Cowles. They wed three years ago.

After Boyzone's bitter 2000 split Stephen carved out a solo career, becoming an accomplished stage star. His 2003 West End stint as Joseph was acclaimed as was his spell as the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He also appeared in ITV1's Dancing on Ice.

But he confessed to battling frightful depression after Boyzone split. He said: ""It was weird being on your own in Asia promoting yourself and not having your buddies. I was on anti-depressants for a couple of years.""

The Boyzone reunion in 2008 was the gig Stephen had been waiting for. Their tour sold out and new single Love You Anyway hit No 5.

409,"Britney Spears: The inside story behind her demons - she was scared of drunken dad

Britney Jean Spears was not born into a stable home.

It was a traumatic scene that no child should ever have to see, but one that was replayed over and over again in the young life of Britney Spears.

Her father Jamie was shouting, her mother Lynne lay crumpled in a heap on the kitchen floor. Then, her dad begging for forgiveness at her feet, Lynne would give him yet another chance.

Such distressing, emotionally-charged episodes were all too familiar during Britney's childhood.

Her fans saw a beautiful, smiling girl who told sugar-coated tales of an idyllic childhood. But her close family knew that the reality was, sadly and starkly, very different.

Britney Jean Spears was not born into a stable home. She was born into a dysfunctional disordered one because of her father's alcoholic rages.

The rows and fights she witnessed left her a bundle of nerves that others, including her own mother, would mistake for natural excitement or energy.

Her Uncle Willie - Jamie's brother - bore witness to some of the ugly incidents.

He says: ""One time Jamie was drunk and tried to drive off with Britney in the car. She was no more than five years old.

""I tried to stop him, so I reached into the truck to grab the keys from the ignition and he punched me. We got right into it there by the car, fighting in front of her.

""Britney was jumping up and down, crying. Lynne had to run out to get her inside.

""We Spears men are known for fighting. If Britney happened to be there, so be it.

""Another time I was at the house and Jamie walked in drunk and called Lynne a bad name. She was in the kitchen drinking water and he grabbed the glass, walked into the lounge and just hurled it. It was rough, but the sad thing is that it became normal life.

""At first, Britney was a scared child and you'd catch her crying but she reached the stage when she just walked off, as if it wasn't happening. And as she got older, she would scream and curse at her parents, trying to get them to stop fighting.""

When yet another row erupted at their modest three-bedroom bungalow in Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney would seek refuge in her aunt Chanda's trailer, parked nearby.

Chanda recalls Britney as sweet but timid. A girl made quiet and withdrawn by all the hollering and verbal abuse - until she had to perform.

Britney's need to perform allowed her to escape the pain and anxiety of home.

Although she is prone to over-analysing and appointing self-blame for her past troubles, her parents had their problems long before she was born.

In fact, her mother filed for divorce in 1980, a year before Britney was even conceived. Those legal papers reveal the flip side of Britney's childhood, offering insights into the adult she would turn into and the father who would become her legal guardian in 2008.

Lynne's divorce application was on the grounds of adultery. According to the petition, Jamie cheated on Christmas Day, 1979.

The legal papers allege that Jamie was seen in a Kentwood bar with a local woman and was ""observed hugging, kissing and fondling this woman"". From there, Lynne writes, they went to the Spears' trailer: ""Where he committed adultery during the late evening hours of December 25 and the early morning hours of December 26.""

Lynne also sought a restraining order. Her petition says: ""She fears the defendant will become angry when served with these papers; that he will harass and/or physically harm her, especially if he has been drinking.""

Divorce papers were withdrawn in March 1980. But they finally split 20 years later.

Jamie's friends describe him as ""a man with a big heart, a good soul but a stronger liver"".

He and Britney have had their problems. But after having treatment for alcohol addiction in 2004, Jamie emerged a new man and was determined to be a better father.

It was Jamie who rescued his fragile daughter when she was at her lowest point.

And now ,with him as her legal guardian, Britney's life is on the up again...

Family in the poverty trap

The full extent of the Spears' poverty has never fully been told.

But some periods were so dark and desperate that Britney would go to the fridge and find it bare.

She has told friends that ""people don't realise how broke we were"".

Her dad would hunt for food in the woods near their home - that meant eating rabbit and squirrel.

Mum Lynne and dad Jamie began their married life in a cramped trailer at Simpson's Trailer Park in Kentwood.

They had progressed to a small bungalow before Britney was born, but Jamie neglected the family gym business and bills went unpaid. It didn't help that he played poker. Often he lost, and he lost heavily. And then he drank heavily.

In 1998, as Britney got a record deal, the family business went bust with debts including $31,000 in unpaid taxes.

A family friend says: ""Years of working every hour God sent to fund Britney's dream caught up with them.""

Now, thanks to Britney amassing a $40million fortune, the family's money worries are finally over.

She was on Prozac at 18

Britney had stunning looks, bags of talent, a multi-million dollar fortune and worldwide fame. But away from the cameras she was a nervous wreck and had been prescribed Prozac (used for depression and panic attacks) at the age of 18.

During the European leg of her Oops! I Did It Again tour in the winter of 2000, she began having ""massive anxieties"" in the middle of the night. A source close to her says: ""She had trouble sleeping and crying fits. She was restless and agitated. Nights were the only times she was alone and she struggled with that... When nothing was happening, it drove her crazy. Only exhaustion would knock her out.""

Such anxiety was not drug-induced. This was Britney's natural state, but heightened by fame. Her moods started to swing noticeably, high and happy one minute, sad and brooding the next. She just dismissed it as ""silly ole me!""

Such was the level of concern that Britney was prescribed Prozac but she treated it like headache tablets, taking a pill only on the days she awoke depressed. This seemed to make her more manic.

There were 10 of us on board including the pilot, but 45 minutes into the flight I heard him talking to air traffic control frantically.

Looking out of the window I saw we were flying dangerously low. Seconds later there was a deafening thud as one wing was ripped off by treetops.

Other passengers ran around screaming but I stayed incredibly calm. I have a strong Christian faith, and remained belted into my seat, praying my life would be spared.

Minutes later the plane nose-dived to the ground. Other people were flung through the windscreen, including a man who had also stayed in his seatbelt.

People were covered in cuts and gashes, and blood was pouring from the pilot's face, but miraculously everyone had survived.

Somehow, I was the only one who had come through without a scratch. I felt shock, gratitude and amazement.

Dazed, we split into two groups of five to search for rescuers. The pilot had been in contact with air traffic control so we assumed the crash would have been recorded and search parties would be out looking for us.

I was wearing just a thin silk blouse, light jeans and open-toe sandals as we stumbled away from the wreckage.

I didn't cry. I knew I had to be strong and in control if I was to stand any chance of survival.

We had crashed in the Rwenzori Mountains in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was freezing cold, the sky was thick and dark with fog and the mountains were covered in a dense jungle of brambles. But the dangerous terrain and cold were the least of our worries.

I had lived in Africa until my family moved to England when I was 17, but I knew enough about this region to know wild animals and hostile rebel soldiers were as big a threat as the icy temperatures.

Some passengers sobbed and wailed and it started raining as night fell so our group clung on to a tree for protection from the elements. I didn't sleep though - it wasn't possible, and the ground was too cold and uneven to lie down on. By day two we'd lost two members of our group. Sapped of strength they strayed aimlessly into the jungle, never to be seen again. We had to assume they had died and carry on.

The three left in our group started walking the next day, desperately hoping to head towards some sort of civilization. There was nothing to eat and only swamp water to drink, but I refused that. Days and nights went by with us walking miles, with no sign of rescue and hope fading.

I focused on survival - seeing my little girl and my family again and turning this disaster into something positive one day. Without those thoughts I would have perished.

Another survivor died trying to swim across a fast-flowing stream, and by the ninth night the only other person in my group was so delirious with hunger he grabbed my arm and tried to bite me. I realised he was trying to eat me and slapped him until he let go. After that I walked on alone.

It was only then, stumbling in the dark, that I realised my legs were swollen and sore. But there was nothing I could do, so I carried on walking through snow, rain and thunderstorms. Giving up wasn't an option, and hunger pains and bitter cold had to be tolerated.

Then, on day 10, I saw men through a clearing. My heart leapt with hope, but I didn't know if they were rescuers or rebels. Luckily for me, they were helpful.

I'd made it.

Too exhausted and shocked to feel relief and sad to learn I was the only survivor, I was stunned to discover I'd walked over 100 miles in 10 days, surviving on nothing.

My family, who had thought I was dead, quickly arranged for me to be airlifted to the Lister Hospital in London.

After that my memories roll into each other, but I remember being told I had gangrene in my legs because of frostbite and that the dead bodies of my fellow passengers were on the plane I was carried away in.

They had all succumbed to starvation or infection.

I don't recall pain or fear, despite my swollen legs and cuts from thorns all over my body. I just focused on being strong and surviving this final hurdle.

By the time I was examined in London some of my toes were falling off. I had a seven-hour operation to amputate both my legs below the knee, and was told later I'd only had hours to live because the gangrene would have travelled to my heart and killed me.

Afterwards I stayed in hospital for 10 days, then went to a specialist unit where I learned to walk again with false limbs. My two sisters helped look after me, but after a month I managed to walk a mile, and after two months I was back home with my daughter.

I didn't feel self-pity. I'd made a deal with myself: If I survived and got back to safety I would use my experience to help others, and that's what I did.

Four months after the crash I went back to college and set up a charity for amputees in West London.

Then I did a degree and set up the disabled charity Richmond User Independent Living Scheme.

But this year my real dream has started to unfold. I launched Rock Rehabilitation to help provide treatment, counselling, and specialist training to improve lives of Ugandan amputees. I've just delivered the first consignment of 300 wheelchairs and I want to raise at least $1million.

In Uganda, if you lose a limb your life is considered over, but I'm living proof it doesn't have to be, and I want people to have the same opportunities as me.

Before the crash I never jogged, swam or played tennis, now I do all three. My life is busier and more fulfilling than ever.

I want others in my situation to be able to enjoy life again, just like me.",uncertain,training
436,"Dad and daughter die in M25 plane crash

A dad and his three-year-old daughter were killed yesterday when their light aircraft crashed into a field next to a busy motorway and burst into flames.

The plane narrowly missed the M25 when it nose-dived moments after taking off from a private airstrip at 4.15pm. A woman, believed to be the little girl's mum, crawled out of the burning wreckage. Her injuries are not life threatening.

Emergency services were scrambled and firefighters put out the blaze.

But nothing could be done to save the woman's daughter and 43-year-old pilot husband who were pronounced dead at Navestock, near Brentwood, Essex. The crash was witnessed by a horrified local farmer.

He said: ""The runway runs out the back of ours and up the field. I was working in a field with my uncle and we watched the plane take off. It went over the top of the trees and came down into a back field and caught fire.

""The owner was local - it was a man, his wife and his daughter. It is terrible."" But an even worse tragedy was averted as the plane narrowly missed crashing onto the M25 jammed with Bank Holiday traffic.

437,"Exclusive: Stewardess In Crash Panic

A stewardess kept screaming: ""We're going to crash,"" when a packed jet hit turbulence at 30,000ft causing panic among passengers.

The cabin crew member shouted out three times as travellers were tossed around and trays, drinks and bags flew through the air.

Passenger Paul Gibson, 30, said: ""She began screaming every time the plane shook.

""She shouted at the top of her voice, ""We're going to crash! We're going to crash! We're going to crash!""""

Virgin Atlantic flight VS043 hit bad weather three hours into its journey from Gatwick to Las Vegas.

The stewardess, who is in her mid-20s, was terrified. One passenger was smashed into the overhead lockers of the Boeing 747-400 while others, some in tears, gripped their seats and prayed.

Some were trapped in the toilets or sat petrified on the floor. Many of the 469 passengers and crew vomited and the cabin was strewn with sick bags.

The pilot told the screaming stewardess and other crew members to strap themselves into their seats. She sat for an hour tossing sick bags across the aisle to frightened customers.

Mr Gibson, editorial director of Chauffeur Magazine, was on his way to a limousine industry conference on Friday. He said: ""The turbulence started very suddenly and one member of cabin crew said it was the worst they had experienced in seven years of flying.""

""Passengers who were walking about the aircraft had to sit on the floor and hold on for dear life.""

""Loads of people were being sick and when someone shouted at the stewardess for more sick bags, she picked up a dozen and threw them across the cabin.""

""It was raining sick bags. The aircraft was in chaos.""

""People were crying and being sick everywhere and then there was an announcement that the people stuck in the toilets would have to stay there until the turbulence had stopped.""

""One passenger hit his head on the overhead luggage compartments as he wasn't strapped in.""

""Afterwards, no apology was made over the loud speakers. The supervisor on the aircraft was informed that complaints would be made against the stewardess.""

Virgin Atlantic said: ""The crew report stated that there was severe turbulence.

""Crew were asked to remain in their seats for an hour.""

439,"Exclusive: Car Crash Con Gang

Gangs are deliberately crashing cars into lorries in an #8million insurance scam exposed by the Mirror today.

It is close to midnight outside a pizza parlour - and four cars nearby are waiting to be crashed into innocent drivers so gangs can scam a fortune from fake insurance claims.

A 6ft Asian with cropped hair who belongs to one of four gangs in the South East each pocketing #2million a year from the con, is to coordinate the night's kamikaze mayhem.

In the next six hours two lorries will become victims, careering into the rear of cars which brake heavily in front of them.

The truck drivers suspect nothing because in each case they have seen another car swerving in front of the motors they have hit. Unknown to them, the driver of the second car is also a gang member.

While the accomplice's car speeds off, the lorry driver and ""victim"" exchange details.

The trucker's insurance then pays out on a claim for vehicle damage - and maybe personal injury and hire of a replacement vehicle - filed by a crooked claims company.

Sickeningly, while in it mainly for the money, the fraudsters get kicks from each crash, laughing at the terrified faces of drivers as they are run off the road at up to 70mph. Ten vehicles a night can be targeted.

First up at the pizza parlour, in Ruislip, West London, was a Nissan Primera. The Asian gang boss was in a black Renault Clio with two passengers.

For 40 minutes the two cars drove in convoy up and down the A40 dual carriageway, searching for the right lorry to target.

They were unaware that they were being tailed by the Mirror which swung into action after receiving a tip-off.

Soon after midnight, they spotted a 40-tonne, 18-wheeled red articulated truck belonging to a group of freight forwarders. The Nissan slipped into the inside lane in front of the vehicle, with the Renault holding back.

Then, as the lorry approached the Londonbound A40 exit, the Renault overtook both vehicles and veered sharply across the path of the Nissan.

The Nissan slammed on its brakes just five yards in front of the lorry, with both vehicles travelling at 40mph.

The lorry slammed into its rear, caving in the bodywork. Metal and glass flew across the road.

Both drivers struggled to keep control and bring their vehicles to a halt.

Each vehicle could have careered off the road, caused a pile-up with other traffic. Innocents could easily have been killed.

Its work done, the Clio sped from the scene. Shocked, the lorry driver swapped details with those in the Nissan, relieved that he had not injured anyone.

He had no idea that those he was talking to had deliberately and cynically caused the crash.

Fifteen minutes later, with roadside formalities complete, the battered Nissan was slowly driven to a nearby McDonald's car park.

The gang members laughed and joked as they were reunited. They reckoned it was a job well done. Using a #30,000 Mercedes A-class ""crash car"" and a Mercedes C-class the gang then prowled the A4 and M4 carriageways near Chiswick. But they failed to find a victim.

After an hour they changed to a silver Rover photographed earlier by the Mirror. While the Clio waited at a junction near the A406 North Circular, the Rover parked in the forecourt of a Shell garage 100 metres up the road. Just after 3am, the gang spotted a Sainsbury's artic, The Rover pulled on to the A406 in front of it. But the drivers got their split-second timing wrong, and the chance of an accident was missed.

The process was repeated 11 minutes later - but again the timing was not right. Then the gang struck gold. A lorry approached and the Rover pulled in front.

We watched as the unlit Renault emerged from its side road directly into the path of the Rover. The Rover slammed on its brakes, managing to dodge the Renault - but making the lorry behind crunch into its rear.

The huge vehicle shunted the Rover 40 metres down the carriageway - amazingly in a straight line rather than into the path of oncoming traffic or on to the pavement.

The Asian got out of the Rover and leaned over the back of his vehicle claiming he had jarred his back in the impact.

The shaken and stunned lorry driver quickly gave his details to the gang.

Over the next two and a half hours, the gang tried several times to crash a red Peugeot 406 into lorries on the A316 road between Chiswick and Mortlake.

But several attempts to make lorries smash into it at traffic lights failed. Finally, with daylight fast approaching, the villains decided it was time for bed.

The Mirror, who befriended members of one of the gangs, was told the scam has been running in the UK for at least four years.

Up to 80 cars to be crashed - known as ""clients' cars"" - are stored at any one time in garages across London. They come from a variety of sources. Some are supplied by their owners who want to cash in on the fiddle. Others may be stolen.

Sometimes, if cars are only slightly dented in crashes, they will be battered with baseball bats later to boost potential claims.

The claims are then handled by at least six dodgy firms who exploit a loophole in the law that says a person's identity does not have to be proved to win a payout.

Because each claim is only about #500 or #600, it slips under the radar of the regulatory authority checks. Drivers who hit another vehicle up the back are nearly always assumed to be guilty.

In March alone, one gang received #14,500 for personal injury claims. They used four solicitors to make similar claims.

The gangs target lorries because they are slower at emergency braking, cause more damage, and claims through company-owned vehicles are rarely contested.

Gangs involved are also believed to be linked to gun-running and drug dealing.

The scam is being taken so seriously a multi-million pound system called the Insurance Fraud Bureau was set up by insurance companies in July to share intelligence on suspicious claims.

A confidential ""cheatline"" allowing people to report incidents of suspected insurance fraud was also set up.

The Association of British Insurers believes that #4million a week is being made on fake claims by criminal gangs.

It is estimated that the total number of bogus and inflated insurance claims costs the industry more than #1.5billion, adding around five per cent to the average premium.

Stephen Sklaroff, deputy director of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""Last year we detected fraudulent claims worth more than #400million.

But the growth in organised fraud requires a new approach.""",uncertain,training

Fromer Blink-182 member and DJ AM both badly burned

The father of two was badly burned after travelling on a Learjet that crashed after bursting into flames on the runway. Also seriously injured was club idol DJ AM, the ex-fianc? of Nicole Richie. The pair were seen leaping from the inferno before frantically extinguishing the flames that engulfed them with their bare hands.

Two fellow passengers, including Travis' assistant, Chris Baker, and two crew died in the crash at a small municipal airport in South Carolina. Travis, 32, was said to have suffered horrific burns from the waist down but was conscious at the hospital. DJ AM - real name Adam Goldstein, 35 - has severe burns to his face.

They both had emergency surgery unaware that the four other people on the plane had died. The pair were seen by millions of TV viewers earlier this month when they performed as the house band at the MTV Video Music Awards. The show's host, British comic Russell Brand, was said to be ""praying they survive"".

Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Travis and DJ AM boarded the jet after performing together under the name TRVSDJ-AM at a free concert for 10,000 fans in Columbia. Their jet overshot the runway and came to rest on a busy main road just before midnight on Friday (local time). Ms Bergen added: ""Air traffic controllers reported seeing sparks along its fuselage.""

It is believed the pair were due to fly back to Los Angeles. Travis was married to former Miss USA?Shanna Moakler, with who he have two children.? Their marriage featured in an Osbournes-style MTV reality series, Meet the Barkers.

Shanna was said last night to be in a ""state of shock"" and was flying to Barker's hospital bedside in Augusta, Georgia. Her mother, who is taking care of the couple's children, said the former pair have spoken over the phone but that they are ""waiting a bit to see what God brings"".

A scene in the FOX ensemble song-and-dance series airing Wednesday where the cast performs ""Proud Mary"" in wheelchairs to support their paraplegic pal, Artie (Kevin McHale), deprives a disabled actor a shot at stardom, says CSI cast member Robert David Hall.

Police stopped traffic on the motorway before the bikers left the service station, bound for Salford.

Animal welfare activists bared almost all in a protest at the bearskin hats worn by Buckingham Palace Guards.

Wearing little more than fake bearskin caps and Union flags painted on their backsides, 21 members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Europe (Peta) performed a ""21 bum salute"" at Tower Bridge, London.

The protesters, holding a banner that read Bare Skin, Not Bear Skins, called on the Ministry of Defence to stop the killing of black bears for The Queen's Guards' ceremonial headwear. The hunt is about to get under way in Canada.

Peta claims some bears are shot several times before they die while others escape and bleed to death.

In the past five years, Peta says the MoD has spent more than $321,000 on ornamental bearskin hats and stalled the adoption of hats fashioned from fake fur.

""There are no ifs, ands or buts about it, killing bears for ceremonial caps is needlessly cruel,"" said Peta's Anita Singh.

A spokesman for the MoD said: ""The MoD does appreciate how strongly many people feel about this issue and remains keen to reduce the requirement for new caps where possible.

Irwin was filming a segment for a show called ""Ocean's Deadliest"" when he swam on top of a stingray. The animals have a poisonous barb on the end of their tails, and the stingray's barb went through his ribcage and into his heart, killing him, according to his friend and colleague, John Stainton.

""The world has lost a great wildlife icon, a passionate conservationist and one of the proudest dads on the planet,"" Stainton told reporters. ""He died doing what he loved best and left this world in a happy and peaceful state of mind. He would have said, 'Crocs Rule!'""

He leaves behind his American-born wife, Terri, who was often referred to as the ""Crocodile Huntress,"" and two children, 8-year-old daughter Bindi Sue and his nearly 3-year-old son, Bob.

Questions were raised last night after Zimbabwean PM Morgan Tsvangirai was injured and his wife killed in a car crash.

Mr Tsvangirai was appointed only three weeks ago after hammering out a power-sharing deal with bitter rival Robert Mugabe.

He and wife of 31 years Susan were heading to a rally when an oncoming truck hit their car 30 miles south of capital Harare yesterday.

The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader, 56, suffered minor injuries but Susan, mum to his six children, died in hospital.

In a statement, the MDC said: ""We suspect that this is not a genuine accident.

""We appeal to Zimbabweans to remain calm as facts continue to surface.""

The party -- which governs with tyrant Mugabe's ZANU-PF -- said a ""few individuals bent on derailing the inclusive government"" were probably behind ""these evil acts"".

But, tellingly, it added: ""We are, however, alive to the fact that a lot of Robert Mugabe's opponents died in suspicious road accidents involving army trucks.""

The UK foreign office said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"". Gordon Brown sent his condolences to Mr Tsvangirai -- who gave his first speech to Zimbabwe's Parliament as PM on Wednesday.

Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president since independence in 1980, is known to want ZANU-PF to have the upper hand in the new administration.

His generals have a history of arranging road ""accidents"" to wipe out threats. However, roads in financially-crippled and cholera-plagued Zimbabwe are notoriously dangerous. There were reports the truck driver was asleep.

Mugabe visited the premier in a Harare clinic. Mr Tsvangirai's biographer Sarah Hudleston said: ""He'll be devastated. He told me the best thing he ever did was marry Susan.

""The people would judge who was best for the job.""

The Premier also said he would not mind if any of his children wanted to marry a Muslim, saying: ""I would respect it, if that was their decision and they were in love and happy.""

Earlier, he delivered a lecture on race and religion in front of an invited audience of community leaders, race chiefs and the media.

He celebrated the contribution made by Britain's ethnic minorities and praised the wider community's acceptance of people's backgrounds.

He said Britain was a haven for all people and praised interview with Arsenal's French footballer Thierry Henry, in which he claimed Britain was one of the world's most tolerant countries. Mr Blair said: ""I read it. I thought it was excellent. And I think Thierry Henry is a really great bloke, by the way.""

The PM said Britain had changed for the better in the last 30 years, with offensive remarks and stupid stereotypes driven out of everyday conversation. According to figures, only 12 per cent of people would mind if a close relative married a black or Asian person.

Mr Blair again acknowledged that he would not have a problem if his son or daughter brought home a Muslim.

But he again defended Commons Leader Jack Straw's comments over the veil -- while pointing out that most extremists were young men, not women in niqabs.

He said it was a matter of common sense that, when speaking to someone, you could see their face.

Mr Blair called Channel 4's Alternative Christmas Message, which will feature a woman wearing a veil for the first time, ""a joke"".

He said: ""I won't be watching. I'll be watching the Queen's speech.""

Mr Blair pointed out that there was a great deal of discussion on the issue of veils going on within the Muslim community.

The PM added: ""When Jack Straw made his comments, no less a person than the Mufti of the Arab Republic of Egypt made an approving statement.""

Mr Blair pleased Muslims members of his audience by referring to extremists as a ""fringe element"".

Many Muslims feel aggrieved over the way the war on terror has been handled and feel they have been tainted and are all under suspicion.

But Mr Blair defined a moderate Muslim, saying this was ""someone who believes if you have a disagreement with someone, then you change it by peaceful means"".

He said it was not about how religion was practised, but stressed that it was everyone's duty to integrate.

He added: ""If you are permitted to stay here permanently, you become an equal member of our community and become one of us.""

Mr Blair argued the great thing about Britain is that people can worship as they wish.

With six titles under his belt so far this year, and a meteoric rise through the rankings, Murray has every right to feel more relaxed, but he is still wary of saying the wrong thing.

He was slammed for a badly received joke about supporting ""anyone but England"" during the 2006 World Cup.

And he was accused of sexism after saying that he and an opponent had ""played like women"". So the Dunblane-born star says he now avoids humour when talking to the media. ""If I say something that offends people, I'm obviously not happy about that, but if it's something that I believe in then that's unfortunate,"" he said.

""We do more than 100 press conferences a year, you're bound to say something wrong. It's difficult.

""It's a lot less time-consuming and a lot easier to just be serious the whole time and not have that much fun with it, otherwise you spend the whole time having to explain yourself afterwards.""

Sitting in the player's lounge at the Palais Omnisports in Bercy, Paris, Murray is easy-going and reveals a self-deprecating side that has seen him admit to having ""the most boring voice in Britain"".

And he laughed as he dismissed suggestions he might dash the hopes of female fans by marrying his girlfriend of four years Kim Sears. He said: ""I don't think so, not for a good few years.""

But Murray shares his new Surrey mansion with the English literature student, who is credited with improving his image, not least by convincing him to cut his hair. ""People will still say, she's with him for the money or fame, whereas I do think with Kim that's not necessarily the case. Why is she with me? It's a good question actually,"" he says laughing.

Murray, who spends a marathon 30 weeks a year on tour, added: ""I don't mind the distance, it's a lot easier to be honest.

""When you do spend time together, you make it work. It's a lot more fun.

""For my age I think we spend more than enough time with each other to get on well and to make things work out.

""But it does get tiring after a while living in hotels. It's nice to come back to your own place and spend a bit of time at home.""

This year's Wimbledon semi-finalist added: ""Kim's dad is a tennis coach and he did a lot of travelling when she was growing up, so she understands how that side of things work, that you're not going to be there all the time, and she doesn't mind me being away and stuff."" He joked: ""That's really helped me. Why she's with me, I don't know, you'd have to ask her.""

Teetotal Murray, who has not touched alcohol since a disastrous experience in a Barcelona nightclub six years ago, prefers to spend his downtime watching TV and going to stand-up comedy gigs by his favourite comics Jimmy Carr, Frankie Boyle and Ricky Gervais.

He is also a self-confessed fan of X Factor's terrible twins Jedward.

Murray, who was knocked out of the Paris Masters in the third round by Czech Radek Stepanek last night, said: ""I do enjoy watching them. I think they are entertaining and compared to a lot of people that are on those shows, they are performing like they would be doing at a concert, it's just obviously the singing's not so good.

""I try and watch it when I can. I missed it last week and will probably miss it this week too. It's tough to keep up."" Murray's sense of fun does spill over into his training time, with marathon warm-down sessions of tennis football against his coach and fitness trainers where the losers pick up forfeits.

He said: ""We just play for stuff that's embarrassing. If there's a crowd of people watching practices, you might have to do muscle poses for a minute, or dancing for a minute.

""I had to wear a pink tracksuit for three days and my fitness trainer had to wear one for a week after a bet last year.

""We were both trying to do our Christmas shopping and walking around on our own in Miami and it was just really uncomfortable. There's been a lot of bad forfeits like that.""

Despite now having celebrity fans of his own, including Sean Connery, David Beckham and US comedian Will Ferrell, he is very clear about keeping his feet on the ground.

Murray - who rose to world No2 in the rankings this season until a left wrist injury forced him to take several weeks off - said: ""I've never really been starstruck, but everyone I've met has been really, really nice. I don't think you ever get used to being famous.

""But I still really live a normal life. I've got the same group of friends that I've had since I was 14 or 15. As long as your friends treat you the same, I don't think you change that much.""

Asked what fans can expect from him in 2010, Britain's best Grand Slam hope in years was instantly back in serious tennis mode, replying: ""My 110 per cent effort.

""You never know about the results and you don't know what's going to happen but I'm obviously going to try to win the big tournaments and improve my ranking and hopefully get better.""

Then he relaxed again, adding: ""But you never know, so I'll just try and enjoy myself.""",uncertain,test

In a bid to show support for the capital's gay community, Boris joined tens of thousands of marchers for a noisy and colourful procession.

Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I don't even know what I was taking."" After a 2005 stint in rehab, he says he relapsed and nearly died from an overdose after ingesting unidentified blue pills an acquaintance had given him.

But as bad as I was back then, I can't even say 100 percent for sure. My doctor told me the amount of methadone I'd taken was equivalent to shooting up four bags of heroin.

The mystery is over.

The secret to First Lady Michelle Obama's killer arms? Tricep pushdowns and hammer curls. 

In the October issue of Women's Health, her longtime personal trainer Cornell McClellan speaks out for the first time, revealing Mrs. Obama's buzzed-about workout routine.

Perform one set of tricep pushdowns using a straight bar attached to the high pulley of a cable station and then, without resting, follow with a set of hammer curls using dumbbells, she advises.

Then, immediately repeat the entire process until two or three sets of both exercises have been completed, adds McClellan.

McClellan says that at the end of an intense routine of cardio workouts and weight training, Mrs. Obama, 45 -- known for her sleeveless outfits -- tones her arms by finishing with the ""arm-shaping superset"" of tricep pushdowns and hammer curls.

McClellan - who began working with Mrs. Obama in 1997 at his Chicago fitness studio - says the first lady is ""truly committed herself to the importance of health and fitness.""

Though President Barack Obama likes his occasional burger, Mrs. Obama says she has been trying to get her family to eliminate processed foods, cut back on sugary drinks and eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.

Robert Thompson, one of the killers of toddler James Bulger, has moved in with his gay lover, it was claimed last night.

The 23-year-old is reported as being in a ""long-term relationship"" with a man he met following his release from custody five years ago.

At first, his partner was unaware of his gruesome past, sources claim.

But when the relationship became serious, he revealed that he was one of the killers of two year-old James.

He had to tell his partner of the murder to meet the strict conditions of his release, which force him to be honest about his past if he forms close relationships.

In 1993, he and his friend Jon Venables abducted James from a shopping centre and led him across Liverpool before torturing him and then battering him to death on a railway line.

Detectives in the case believe Thompson thought up the plan to kidnap the toddler and was more violent than Venables.

The two killers were aged just ten at the time. Thompson now has no regular access to children.

Sources close to him say he is now in a settled relationship with another man. They also claim that he has been living with his lover -- whose age is not known -- for several months.

The killer was not previously known to have been gay.

It is believed that Thompson, who lives at a secret location in North West England, has settled back well into the community and is not considered a risk to the public.

Since the two killers were released after serving eight years in child detention centres -- the public have not been allowed to know much about their lives.

The pair cannot contact each other.

And Thompson was given a new identity, including a name, passport and National Insurance number. A High Court injunction protects his new identity.

The child killer has received huge financial support from taxpayers through the Home Office and Probation Service since his release.

He is allowed to claim benefits to stop him turning to crime when he is not in work.

He also has access 24 hours a day to probation officers if he needs advice.

While in custody, he was encouraged to develop an interest in textiles and won praise for a wedding dress he designed.

Thompson was held at a detention centre in Barton Moss, near Eccles, on the outskirts of Manchester.

Venables was locked up at the Red Bank Children's Home on Merseyside.

It was just 13 miles from the home of James Bulger's family in Kirby.

The cost of keeping the pair in secure units was around $150,000 a year -- making the total $2.5million for their total sentences.

Cannibal chef Anthony Morley was jailed for life yesterday for what a judge branded a ""cold-blooded, savagely executed murder"".

Judge James Stewart QC told gay Morley he would serve a minimum of 30 years for killing Damian Oldfield.

Morley, 36, was found guilty of murdering Mr Oldfield, 33, last week.

He slashed Mr Oldfield's throat before stabbing him repeatedly and then cooking and eating sections of his flesh.

Judge Stewart told him: ""Before this case, I had associated cannibalism with eras long gone, with the tale of Robinson Crusoe. No longer.

""You have plumbed depths rarely encountered in our court.""

People in the public gallery applauded and shouted ""murderer"" as Judge Stewart revealed Morley's sentence.

During the trial, Leeds Crown Court heard how Morley carved a section of flesh from Mr Oldfield's thigh and one from his chest.

Six pieces of human flesh, cooked so they were raw in the middle and browned on the edges, were found on a chopping board in Morley's kitchen.

A bundle of fresh herbs, a knife used to chop them, some olive oil and a dish of seeds were found on the work surface near the cooker and a frying pan was on the hob with the remnants of fried herbs and oil in it.

A section of flesh, which appeared to have been chewed, was found in a bin bag.

Morley, the first Mr Gay UK in 1993, had previously had a relationship with openly gay Mr Oldfield.

Morley claimed he killed Mr Oldfield after waking up in his bedroom in Leeds to find him performing a sexual act and said he feared he was going to be raped.

But Judge Stewart rejected the claim and told him he had encouraged Mr Oldfield and consented to sexual activity.

The judge said Morley was ""highly dangerous"" when he had been drinking and described an incident when he attacked an ex-boyfriend with a meat cleaver.

When Vicky Jaggers had a baby at the age of 12 she told her stunned parents the father was a boy she'd met on holiday.

But the shocking truth was that Vicky had been raped by her 18-year-old brother and was too traumatised to tell her mum and dad.

Amazingly, Vicky kept the terrible secret for 18 years.

But when psycho Jaggers then kidnapped and raped his girlfriend, Vicky knew she had to break her silence.

She confessed to her 18-year-old daughter Kirsty that her uncle was really her dad. Then she told her mother how she'd been raped in the family home.

Finally, with incredible bravery, Vicky went to police and gave evidence that helped get Jaggers caged.

Now Vicky, 32, has courageously waived her right to anonymity as a rape victim and told The People: ""I hate my brother for what he did tome.

""The fear and guilt wrecked my life for 18 years. But I've never regretted having my beautiful daughter even though she was the result of that brutal rape.""

And her daughter, now 20, said: ""I was hurt when I found out I was the result of his rape, that something so terrible had happened for me to exist.

""But I actually feel closer to my mum since she told me the truth. I love her to bits.""

Vicky admits she and her two brothers and one sister had a traumatic childhood.

Her parents were relief pub managers who spent just a few months in one place. The children's schooling was disrupted and they had few friends and little stability.

In 1987 when Vicky was 12 she and her parents were living in a pub in Sussex and David, 18, who had his own flat, sometimes spent the night there.

Vicky recalled: ""He used to pick on me when I was little, but there was no hint of the terrible thing he'd go on to do.""

""I'd gone to bed at 10pm while my parents were downstairs working. I was fast asleep when something woke me up. David was getting into my bed. I was terrified and froze.""

""He didn't say anything, he just climbed on top of me, lifted my nightie and raped me.""

""It probably only lasted ten minutes but it felt like hours and I sobbed with the pain. I remember seeing his face in the half light and it was just blank.""

""Then he got up and walked out, leaving me crying my eyes out. I didn't sleep that night and I haven't slept properly since.""

Vicky was too scared to tell her parents - and next night her brother crept in and raped her again.

She said: ""After that, every time David stayed over I'd sleep on the sheepskin rug in my parents' bedroom. Mum and Dad were never suspicious.""

""One of the locals had told them the pub was haunted so I told them I was frightened."" Six months later, Vicky's mum took her to hospital after she had a bout of vomiting and sickness. Test showed she was pregnant.

Vicky said: ""Mum and Dad were stunned.""

""The police were called so I made up a story about having got carried away with a boy while we were on a caravan holiday about six months before.""

""The birth was very traumatic. But I bonded with Kirsty immediately, she was so beautiful. Mum was prepared to take her on as her own but we never lied.""

""Kirsty knew she was mine from the minute she could speak. She called my mum ""Mummy Granny"" and me ""Vicky Mummy"".""

""I put everything into being a good mum and quite enjoyed it."" Vicky went back to school but rarely attended, preferring to spend time with her daughter.

Then, two years later, in 1989, her world was rocked again. Her brother was arrested for strangling to death his girlfriend Helen Mitchell, 23, in Ockenden, Essex.

Vicky, who had known Helen, fled from home, leaving Kirsty with her mother.

She lived in a squat for nine days, sparking a nationwide police hunt before she was found.

Her brother was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for six years. As Vicky grew up she embarked on a series of unhappy relationships with men sparked by her need to feel protected.

She had a daughter, Alicia, now 15 and a year later gave birth to third daughter Sam, now 14.

Then, in 1994, her dad Len was admitted to hospital with cancer.

Her brother was out of prison and furious that Vicky wouldn't visit her dad.

She said: ""He came round to Mum's house and we had a screaming match. It ended with him putting his hands round my throat and throttling me.""

""I passed out but I wonder now if he thought he'd killed me and that's why he let go.""

Vicky's life changed for the better when she met and married Kelly, 36, whom she calls her ""knight in shining armour"". She added: ""He promised he'd never leave and would always protect me and the kids.""

Then, in December 2004, another shocking twist in her life made Vicky realise she had to tell the truth about her rape ordeal.

A nationwide hunt was launched for Jaggers after he kidnapped and raped another girlfriend.

""It was all over the news,"" recalls Vicky. ""He'd held her prisoner in his van for three days and when police caught him he had knives and a fake gun. He said he wanted the police to shoot him because he was evil.

""That was the breaking point for me. I knew I had to come forward about what he'd done to me.

""I sat Kelly down, took a deep breath and started to tell him the truth. He sat listening and holding my hand while I sobbed.""

Vicky then told her mum Avril and daughter Kirsty. Vicky said: ""David had always been Mum's golden boy. But she said: ""I'm sorry, I should have been there to protect you"".

""I didn't know how the shock would affect Kirsty but I knew David had to be taken off the streets. He was too dangerous. She broke down in tears - she was dumbfounded that her killer uncle was her dad. But she was crying ""It's not your fault mum, it's not your fault"". Despite the pain it actually brought us even closer. None of this is Kirsty's fault or mine. It's David's.""

Vicky went to the police and DNA samples were taken which proved her brother was Kirsty's father.

Jaggers, now 38, admitted two charges of raping Vicky when he appeared at Basildon Crown Court, Essex, in 2005 but was given just a one-year jail sentence on each count.

He also admitted raping his girlfriend, making threats to kill, false imprisonment and kidnap and was given a life sentence but with a minimum of only six years. His case is due for a review next year and he could moved to an open jail.

Vicky said: ""I was gutted he didn't get longer. When he gets out I will always have to look over my shoulder But my family are so close now that he can never break me.""

Kirsty added: ""I often felt I shouldn't be here but I love my mum so I would never say I shouldn't have been born.""

""I wouldn't let anyone say a bad thing about her. I'm so proud of her and I really admire her for getting through this. She's wonderful.""",uncertain,test

The Berkshire institution, founded in 1863, currently houses some of Britain's most notorious psychopaths, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and Robert Maudsley, who ate part of the brain of one of his four murder victims.

Napper, a paranoid schizophrenic, appears to have settled into a relaxed life among the most sinister figures in UK crime history.

Broadmoor patients do not get woken up until midday. If they miss breakfast they can eat food stored in their own lockers.

They also have keys to their own rooms but to minimise the risk of suicides they are checked hourly by hospital staff.

The 6ft 2in maniac Napper has shown particular interest in sports and the gym, where he plays football, swingball and uses weights and exercise machines.

He is also said to be a keen volleyball player. The Broadmoor source went on: ""Napper loved the game and was pretty good at it too.

""He liked standing tall at the net and smashing the ball down. Napper wasn't very good at football but he always gave it a go.""

He was first sent to Broadmoor in 1995 for the horrific killings two years earlier of Samantha Bisset, 27, and daughter Jazmine, four, at their home in Plumstead, South East London.

On Thursday, he was ordered to be held there indefinitely for his savage killing of Rachel, 23, in 1992, a crime that shocked the nation.

The young mum was knifed 49 times in Wimbledon Common, South London, in front of two-year-old son Alex.

His seemingly relaxed life in the mental hospital will seem scant punishment for his unspeakably heinous crimes.

And while he was in London's tough Belmarsh prison in the mid-90s awaiting trial for the deaths of Samantha and Jazmine, he bragged about how he would be sent to Broadmoor. One former jail pal revealed: ""Broadmoor was all he ever talked about - he didn't seem interested in his case or interested in getting off.

""Instead he spent hours bragging about how all the psychiatrists thought his crimes were so bad that he would have to go to Broadmoor.""

""It got on the other prisoners' nerves, even the ones on the hospital wing where Napper was being assessed.""

""Once, when he wouldn't shut up about it, another prisoner hurled his breakfast of eggs, tomatoes and porridge all over him.""

""Napper ran back to his cell, screaming. He wasn't a tough guy at all.""

However, his cosy routine in Broadmoor was threatened when he was charged in November 2007 over Rachel's death. Some patients claimed to be disgusted by the crime, despite being violent killers.

Several told staff and patients they were going to attack or kill him.

One was Wayne Campbell, who in 1994 murdered his 17-month-old daughter Daniella by stabbing her in the face.

Many of the warped inmates may simply have grown jealous of his new-found notoriety.

But Broadmoor takes such threats very seriously, especially when made by a convicted killer.

A few days after Napper was charged, schizophrenic Patrick Sureda tried to blind Yorkshire Ripper Sutcliffe, with a knife. Napper was quickly moved to a different ward away from other patients and placed under observation.

Napper, who also suffers from the mental disorder Asperger syndrome, is currently receiving several hours' therapy a week with a shrink, Dr Natalie Pyszora.

However, the killer still remains delusional. The Old Bailey trial into Rachel's killing heard he believed he had a Master's degree in Maths, had won the Nobel Peace Prize, been awarded medals for fighting in Angola and had millions stashed in a bank in Sidcup, Kent.

He also believed his fingers had been blown off by an IRA parcel bomb but had miraculously grown back.

Since his conviction on Thursday,  Napper is once more being kept under close watch, with two nurses within arms' length of him at all times.

It is a routine the savage killer will have decades to get used to.",uncertain,training
497,"PC Sharon Beshenivsky's evil killer given 35 years in jail

The third killer of policewoman Sharon Beshenivsky was jailed for life yesterday after it was revealed he was snatched from Africa to face justice in a James Bond-style swoop.

Mustaf Jama, 29, who will serve a minimum of 35 years, was one of a gang who raided a travel agent in November 2005.

They terrified staff with a pistol and machine gun but panicked when they saw police who rushed to the alarm.

Mother of three Sharon, 38, was shot on her youngest daughter's fourth birthday.

Her partner PC Teresea Milburn was wounded. The robbers escaped with just $5,000 in Bradford.

Ringleader Muzzaker Shah and Jama's younger brother Yusuf were caught and jailed for 35 years each for murder.

Despite being Britain's most wanted man, Jama fled to his native Somalia using a friend's passport and $2,000 given by pals.

There were reports he disguised himself as a woman in a burkha, though he later insisted he travelled in ordinary clothes.

Intelligence indicated he was lying low in Somaliland, a region fighting for independence from Somalia.

The British authorities deemed it too dangerous to enter the failed state, so paid armed Somalis to get him out of the country. In October 2007 Jama was snatched from his Land Rover at a roadblock near the village where his father is a warlord, then held by a militia gang in a cell.

A pilot initially refused to fly him to Dubai from a remote airstrip, believing he was an al-Qaeda terror suspect.

He was then shown official documents signed by senior Somali officials and the British Ambassador to Kenya to persuade him to make the flight. British police met Jama at Dubai and put him on a scheduled Virgin flight to Heathrow.

Sentencing him at Newcastle crown court Mr Justice Openshaw said he was one of a ""team of ruthless and dangerous men"".

Sharon's husband Paul Beshenivsky hugged PC Milburn as the guilty verdict was announced.

Jama showed no emotion but made an aggressive hand gesture towards the police gathered in the public gallery.

After the case Mr Beshenivsky said: ""It has not brought closure but it has made me happier to know he has gone down with the rest of them.""

A police spokeswoman said on behalf of Pc Milburn: ""She is relieved Jama will spend the next 35 years in jail along with the others who shot Sharon and her.""

Jama first went on trial in January but the jury failed to reach a verdict.

After he was snatched, he tried to challenge the legality of the extradition, arguing last July at Woolwich crown court that the process amounted to kidnap.

He claimed he was mistreated and hit with the butt of a gun, but a photo showed him smoking happily among his captors.

Three gang members who did not enter the travel agents have also been jailed.",uncertain,training
498,"Smug killer of Harry Potter star to serve 20 years

Murderer Karl Bishop was smirking to the last yesterday as he was given four life terms for the knife rampage that killed Harry Potter actor Rob Knox.

The jobless thug - again showing sneering contempt for the young life he took - stood with his hands in his pockets and looked smug as he glanced at Rob's distraught family.

Bishop, 22, had swaggered into court in a scruffy grey tracksuit and even grinned and waved at his lackeys from the dock.

Judge Mr Justice Bean described his utter absence of remorse ""truly chilling"" as he ordered him to spend at least 20 years behind bars.

Branding the killer a ""very significant"" danger to the public, he said: ""You are a highly dangerous man.""

""I do not think it is proved that you intended to kill Robert Knox.""

""The truth is that you simply could not care less whether you killed him or not. When you learned you had killed Rob, your only response was to say, ""Yeah, sweet"".

""Your lack of regret, let alone remorse, was truly chilling.""

Bishop stabbed Rob, 18, five times and wounded four of his friends in a row in Sidcup, Kent, last May.

The actor - Marcus Belby in the forthcoming Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - stepped in as the lout threatened his brother Jamie, 17. Mr Justice Bean said: ""He paid for his bravery with his life.""

The judge also slammed the blade menace that has sparked the Mirror's five-point anti-knives drive.

He said at the Old Bailey: ""Far too many teenagers have been killed with knives. That's why knife crime must attract deterrent sentences.""

Rob's parents Colin, 55, and Sally, 51, would not comment after Bishop was sent down. Speaking earlier, Sally had vowed not to ""waste any time thinking about him"".

Mr Justice Bean also paid tribute to the parents' ""great dignity"" as they endured hearing harrowing evidence about their son's death.

Bishop got a life term for Rob's murder and three others for wounding Dean Saunders, 23, Nicky Lee Jones, 20, and Charlie Grimley, 17.

The sentences will be served at the same time as his two-year term for wounding Andrew Dormer, 17, in the same brawl.

Bishop had threatened a youth with a blade two months earlier but was never found by cops - leaving him free to murder Rob.

Just 11 months before killing the actor he was freed from a four-year jail term for slashing two youths.",uncertain,test
499,"Costas killer Dezzie Sinclaire has jail term cut

A man who killed a fellow Brit in Spain will serve a significantly reduced jail term after making a plea bargain.

Dezzie Sinclaire, 29, had faced demands he should serve 36 years for killing Roy Thrusell and torching his rented home to hide evidence at Orihuela Costa, near Alicante.

But after Sinclaire, who admitted all charges, made the bargain, the term was cut to 12 years.

He will also pay Mr Thrusell's widow Jacqueline $133,500 compensation and $178,000 each to his daughters Joanne and Catherine.

Sinclaire killed Mr Thrusell, of Essex, in a fight in January 2005, then torched the body and home and fled in his victim's car. He later hired a car to drive to the UK.",uncertain,training
500,"Psycho Nazi Cop Killer Let Out

An evil killer who blasted a police officer to death and shot two others has been freed from jail...

Police chiefs are outraged that Nazi-obsessed maniac Egon Von Bulow was allowed back on the streets just a week after the Queen unveiled the first national memorial to 1,600 officers killed on duty.

The 59-year-old gun nut - who had a warped hatred of police and once vowed to get ""retribution"" on those who caught him - is in a probation hostel and will soon be rehoused in south-east London.

Alarmingly his release comes just four years after prison chiefs refused him parole because they believed there had not been enough improvement in his behaviour. The killer was once described by a senior detective as ""the most dangerous man I have known"".

A risk assessment carried out before he was freed gave him the all clear.

But a source said: ""There are a number of people who think Von Bulow should still be in prison - the jury is out on whether he is fully rehabilitated.""

The news has sickened police chiefs. Inspector John Miskelly, branch chairman of Surrey Police Federation, whose officers were shot by Von Bulow, said: ""What sort of message does this send to criminals? It tells them they can go out and kill a police officer, who is trying to protect the public, knowing they will not get a life sentence and will be released back into the community.

""When an officer is killed on duty then a life sentence should mean just that. This was a horrendous crime and the families are still affected to this day.""

Von Bulow shocked the nation in July 1974 when he shot dead married PC John Schofield, 27. Stopped by police in Caterham, Surrey, later that month for acting suspiciously, he blasted the officers with a pistol before they left their car. Sergeant Harley Findlay, 30, and PC Roy Fullalove, 21, were badly wounded.

Von Bulow then hijacked a car and forced a man to drive through London at gunpoint. He was eventually caught and jailed for life in 1975. His trial heard his home in Lewisham, south-east London,was decorated with Swastika flags and photographs of Adolf Hitler.

The unemployed electrician was a member of the British Rail Rifle Club and used .22 rifles and pistols. He also made detonators.

During police interviews Von Bulow bizarrely pretended to speak only German. He would bow and click his heels as if doing the Nazi ""goose step"".

Ominously he also told a detective: ""If I go to Broadmoor I will have plenty of time to grab my retribution on those bastards who put me there.""

Trial judge Mr Justice Cantley said: ""I detected a deep, underlying malice against the police in his evidence.""

And a senior detective working on the case said: ""There goes the most dangerous man I have ever known.""

At the time PC Schofield's father John called for cop killers like Von Bulow to be hanged. He said: ""It is the only thing that will stop this tragedy happening again. The man who did this should not escape with a sentence in prison.""

Von Bulow's minimum sentence - the tariff - expired in 1998. Yet as recently as 2001 parole board officials refused to free him saying his behaviour still had ""some way to go before a move to open conditions could be contemplated"".

Amazingly, in 2003 Von Bulow was awarded #1,000 by the European Court of Human Rights for ""injured feelings"" over the way his bid for freedom was handled by the parole board.

They accepted his claim to have suffered ""feelings of frustration, uncertainty and anxiety"" and said that after expiry of the tariff, continued detention depended on assessing ""elements of risk and dangerousness that could change with the course of time"".

Shameless Von Bulow had sought damages of #52,000 a year - the amount he claimed he would have earned as a plumber if he had be0en released in 1998.

Last week the Queen unveiled a memorial on The Mall in London to mark the ""courage and personal sacrifice"" of officers who died while doing their duty.

She said: ""When people pass by I hope they will pause and reflect on the proud traditions that it represents.""

A Home Office spokesman said: ""We can not comment on individual cases.""",uncertain,test
